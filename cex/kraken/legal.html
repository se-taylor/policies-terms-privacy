                <strong>Funding your Kraken Account.
                </strong>&nbsp;In order to complete an offer, bid, order, trade or transaction via the Services (including orders and trades on the Kraken Digital Asset Exchange, as described in Section 7), you must first load Assets to your Kraken Account using one of the approved External Accounts identified via the Services.

As further described in Section 9, you may be charged fees by the External Account you use to transmit Assets to or from your Kraken Account. Payward is not responsible for any External Account fees or for the management and security of any External Account. You are solely responsible for your use of any External Account, and you agree to comply with all terms and conditions applicable to any External Account. The timing associated with a load transaction will depend in part upon the performance of third parties responsible for maintaining the applicable External Account, and Payward makes no guarantee regarding the amount of time it may take to load Assets into your Kraken Account.

Kraken does not pay interest on free fiat balances held in your account.&nbsp;

                <br>
                <strong>Digital Assets Only Accounts
                </strong>&nbsp;- If you have opened a Kraken Account designated as Digital Assets Only, you may only fund your account with Digital Assets. Kraken will not accept Legal Tender to fund a Digital Assets Only Account. If Legal Tender is transmitted to fund such an account, it will be returned to the sender, less applicable transfer fees.

                <strong>L2 Funding Services.
                </strong> For certain Digital Assets (such as bitcoin), Kraken may facilitate your ability to use a “Layer 2” network (such as the Lightning Network) to deposit such Digital Assets to your Kraken Account and/or withdraw such Digital Assets to an External Account (the “L2 Funding Services”). Without limiting the generality of the remainder of this Section 6, you acknowledge and agree that:

                <li>
                  <p>Your use of the L2 Funding Services must comply with the relevant instructions provided to you through the Services. If Kraken cannot complete your transaction for any reason (such as the failure to respond to an order exceeding the minimum or maximum order size), your request to use the L2 Funding Services may be rejected or delayed without liability to Kraken;&nbsp;

For example, you acknowledge and agree that, depending on the Layer 2 network, you may be unable to transfer Digital Assets you withdraw to an External Account using the L2 Funding Services back to the base “Layer 1” network (such as the underlying Bitcoin protocol) within a particular period or time, at a particular cost or, in the case of a network malfunction, exploit, Force Majeure event or other mitigating circumstances, at all; Kraken shall bear no liability to you or any other party in this instance; and

                  <p>Layer 2 networks are experimental in nature and present risks associated with using novel distributed ledger technology-based networks, including, but not limited to, vulnerabilities in or unanticipated changes to the applicable Layer 2 network.

                    </strong>Title to Digital Assets shall at all times remain with you and shall not transfer to Payward, except as provided herein. All interests in Digital Assets we hold for Kraken Accounts are held for customers, are not property of Payward. As the owner of Digital Assets in your Kraken Account, you bear all risk of loss of such Digital Assets. None of the Digital Assets in your Kraken Account are the property of Payward. Payward does not represent or treat assets in your Kraken Account as belonging to Payward. However, a court may disagree with Payward’s treatment of your assets and subject them to claims of Payward’s creditors. &nbsp;Except as required by a facially valid court order, or except as provided herein, Payward will not sell, transfer, loan, hypothecate, or otherwise alienate Digital Assets in your Kraken Account unless instructed by you or as otherwise authorized by these Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding Section 7.11.2.2, Payward makes no warranty that Digital Assets in your Kraken Account are held by you free and clear of any security interest or other lien or encumbrance by Payward or others, including but not limited to Payward’s creditors.

If received with respect to Extended Funds (and not Received Assets), you must return any incremental tokens generated as a result of a fork in the digital currency protocol of any Margin Extension or an airdrop of any tokens on the protocol of any Margin Extension. You may terminate a Margin Extension by either: (i) directing immediately available Funds in your Kraken Account to Payward; or (ii) selling requisite Collateral Assets (as defined below) or other assets in your Kraken Account on the Kraken exchange and applying the proceeds to the termination of the corresponding Margin Extension. Prior to satisfying the corresponding Margin Extension pursuant to the preceding sentence, Received Assets and requisite Collateral Assets may not be otherwise transferred to an External Account or traded on the Kraken exchange.

                <strong>Digital Asset trading risks.
                </strong>&nbsp;The risk of loss in trading Digital Asset pairs, and Digital Asset and Legal Tender pairs can be substantial. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources, and you should know the following points:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>You may sustain a total loss of the Funds in your Kraken Account, and, in some cases, you may incur losses beyond such Funds.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This can occur, for example, when the market reaches a daily price fluctuation limit or there is insufficient liquidity in the market.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Placing contingent orders, such as "stop-loss" or "stop-limit" orders, will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>All Digital Asset positions involve risk, and a "spread" position may not be less risky than an outright "long" or "short" position.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>

You agree that Payward may provide these Communications to you by posting them via the Services, by emailing them to you at the email address you provide, and/or by sending an SMS or text message to a mobile phone number that you provide. Your carrier's normal, messaging, data and other rates and fees may apply to any mobile Communications. You should maintain copies of electronic Communications by printing a paper copy or saving an electronic copy. You may also contact us through support

For certain Communications, such as tax forms we’ll need to send to you, you will also need software to view PDF files. You will also need to have a current and valid email address and mobile phone number on file with Payward and have sufficient storage space to save past Communications or an installed printer to print them.

                </a>. If you decline or withdraw consent to receive electronic Communications, Payward may suspend or terminate your use of the Services. Additionally, any withdrawal of consent to receive electronic Communications shall act as your affirmation that your street address on file is current and up-to-date, and any Communications we are required to provide to you may be sent in paper form to that physical address subject to the terms of 10.4 below.

                </a>. In order for us to send paper copies to you, you must have a current street address on file with Payward. Any request for a paper copy of a Communication is limited to that individual piece of Communication and shall not affect your consent to receive all other Communications electronically, as set forth in section 10.1 above. Please note that Kraken operates exclusively online and it is very burdensome for us to produce paper copies of Communications. Therefore, if you request paper copies, you understand and agree that Payward may charge you a processing fee, in the amount described in the

                </strong>&nbsp;It is your responsibility to keep your email address, mobile phone number, and street address on file with Payward up to date so that Payward can communicate with you electronically. You understand and agree that if Payward sends you an electronic Communication but you do not receive it because your email address or mobile phone number on file is incorrect or out of date, our ability to contact you at the email address and/or mobile phone number is blocked by your service provider, or you are otherwise unable to receive electronic Communications, Payward will be deemed to have provided the Communication to you whether or not you actually received the Communication. Please note that if you use a spam filter that blocks or re-routes emails from senders not listed in your email address book, you must add Payward to your email address book so that you will be able to receive the Communications we send to you. You can update your email address, mobile phone number or street address at any time by logging into your Kraken Account or by sending such information to support

      <h2 id="margin-disclosure-statement">Margin Disclosure Statement
      </h2>
      <p>We are furnishing this document to you to provide some basic facts about purchasing digital assets or legal tender on margin, and to alert you to the risks involved with trading assets in a margin account. Before trading assets in a margin account, you should carefully review this margin disclosure statement. Please contact us through support&nbsp;
        <a href="https://support.kraken.com/">https://support.kraken.com
        </a>&nbsp;regarding any questions or concerns you may have with your margin accounts.
      </p>
      <p>When you purchase digital assets for legal tender or vice versa, you may pay in full with your own funds or by posting assets in your account as collateral, with funds provided by Payward to you pursuant to an extension of margin. If&nbsp;the collateral supporting your extension of margin declines in value by an amount specified by Payward, you authorize Payward to&nbsp;issue a margin call and/or sell assets in your account, in order to maintain equity in the account that meets or exceeds the minimum maintenance margin requirement.
      </p>
      <p>It is important that you fully understand the unique risks involved in trading assets using extensions of margin before determining whether such trading is appropriate for you.&nbsp;These risks include the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Using margin to support spot transactions poses a high degree of financial risk and is not suitable for everyone.
          </strong> The use of leverage can work against you as well as for you and can lead to large losses as well as gains. You should examine your financial objectives, financial resources and risk tolerance to determine whether receiving extensions of margin secured by the assets in your Kraken Account is appropriate for you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>You can rapidly lose all of the funds you deposit for trading and may lose more funds than you deposit in your Kraken account.
          </strong> The prices of digital assets are highly volatile and a decline in the value of assets that are purchased or sold on margin may require you to provide additional funds to us, on short notice or with no notice, to avoid the automatic liquidation of assets in your account(s).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>You authorize us to sell assets in your account without further notice to you.
          </strong>&nbsp;If the equity in your account falls below our maintenance margin requirements, you authorize Payward to&nbsp;sell assets in your account to cover the margin deficiency. You will be responsible for any shortfall in the account after such a sale.&nbsp;As Digital Asset markets are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, margin calls and liquidations may occur at any time, including outside of normal business hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>You authorize us to sell your assets without contacting you.
          </strong>&nbsp;Do not mistakenly believe that we must contact you for a margin call to be valid, and that we may not liquidate assets in your account unless we have contacted you first. This is not the case. We will attempt to notify you of margin calls, but we are not required to do so. Moreover, even if we have contacted you and provided a specific date by which you must meet a margin call, we may still immediately sell assets in your account without notice to you and without waiting for the specific date to meet a margin call.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>We can increase maintenance margin requirements with advance notice. 
          </strong>The maintenance margin requirements may result in the issuance of a maintenance margin call. Your failure to satisfy the call may cause us to liquidate or sell assets in your account(s). We are not responsible for delays in the release of funds intended to satisfy the call, including but not limited to internal holds on funds exceeding verification limits, delays in the transfer of funds from external accounts maintained by third-party financial institutions, and failure of proper routing of funds through financial networks. The funds will not count towards meeting the maintenance margin requirements until the funds are released.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. 
          </strong>While Payward might grant you an extension of time to meet margin requirements under certain conditions, you do not have a right to the extension.

        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>(a) Our obligations under this Addendum are limited to the provision of the PSA Services to you at your risk and in accordance with your instructions. 
        <strong>You acknowledge that we cannot guarantee, nor are we in any way responsible for, the acts or omissions of third parties (e.g., Candidates) or the performance of their products or services (e.g., PSA modules, Base Layer Networks, parachain protocols, or PSA Information) that may relate or otherwise be relevant to the PSA Services.
        </strong> Such products and services are made available (directly or indirectly) by such third parties, and we do not make any express or implied warranties or conditions, including quality, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement. By agreeing to this Addendum, you expressly agree that we shall not be held liable for (and you expressly assume the risk of) any matters arising out of or relating to the actions and omissions of such third parties or their products and services. These matters may relate (but are not limited) to:

        </li>
        <li>Any aspect of a Candidate’s Parachain Slot Auction bid (e.g., its success or failure, or whether the corresponding parachain network will be launched, functional, or deemed satisfactory or successful);

      <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the limitations of this section may not apply to you.
      </p>
      <p>(c) This Section 2 applies even where it would otherwise conflict with any other provision of this Addendum.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3. The PSA Services.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>(a) 
        <em>General
        </em>. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Addendum, Payward Trading Ltd., a British Virgin Islands company (“Payward Trading”) may, at its discretion, facilitate your ability to: (i) participate in a Parachain Slot Auction by bonding the DOT/KSM in your Kraken Account, as applicable, to a PSA module in support of a particular Candidate’s bid (“Bonding Services”); (ii) receive Reward Tokens distributed by a winning Candidate in recognition of your support of such Candidate's bid and credit them to your Kraken Account (“Paradrop Services”); and (iii) following a PSA module Expiration Date, claim the DOT/KSM previously bonded to a PSA module (“Unbonding Services” and, together with Bonding Services and Paradrop Services, the “PSA Services”). Payward Trading may perform any or all of the PSA Services directly or through one or more service provider(s), in which case, your authorization and instruction extends to such service provider(s). For clarity, the PSA Services are “Services,” as defined in the Terms.
      </p>
      <p>(b) 
        <em>Bonding Services.
        </em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>By submitting a request to support a Candidate’s bid through the Services, you authorize and instruct Payward Trading to bond the amount of DOT/KSM instructed by you to the PSA module corresponding to that Candidate.
        </li>
        <li>Payward Trading will not be able to attempt to unbond Bonded DOT/KSM prior to its Expiration Date.
        </li>
        <li>You may not transfer, stake, withdraw, trade, bond in other Parachain Slot Auctions or otherwise use your Bonded DOT/KSM until the Expiration Date is reached and Payward Trading claims the assets on your behalf and at your instruction through the Unbonding Services.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>(c) 
        <em>Paradrop Services.
        </em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Candidates may offer supporters who bond DOT/KSM to the Candidate’s PSA module an amount of Reward Tokens. By electing to use the Bonding Services, you irrevocably authorize and instruct Payward Trading to receive any corresponding Reward Tokens on your behalf. In the event of any such receipt, you hereby authorize and instruct Payward Trading, and Payward Trading agrees, to use commercially reasonable efforts to credit them to your Kraken Account on the basis that we describe (i.e., not via PSA Information) through the Services.
        </li>
        <li>The Paradrop Services are limited to claims of the specific Reward Token in accordance with the terms of this Addendum. You do not instruct us, and we have no obligation and make no commitment, to claim any other asset, reward or benefit on your behalf. We also have no obligation, and make no commitment, to facilitate the listing of any Reward Tokens on the Kraken exchange at any time or in any particular jurisdiction.
        </li>
        <li>Payward Trading may withhold and report any tax as required by any applicable law.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>(d) 
        <em>Unbonding Services
        </em>. By electing to use the Bonding Services, you irrevocably authorize and instruct Payward Trading, and Payward Trading agrees, to use commercially reasonable efforts following an applicable Expiration Date to claim your previously Bonded DOT/KSM from the corresponding PSA module on your behalf and credit it to your Kraken Account on the basis that we describe (i.e., not via PSA Information) through the Services.
      </p>
      <p>(e) 
        <em>Ownership
        </em>. During a Parachain Slot Auction, DOT/KSM holders may bond their cryptocurrency (Bonded DOT/KSM) to support the project that they believe should receive a parachain slot. In return, the project may commit to airdrop Rewards Tokens (i.e., a paradrop) to their supporters. During such bonding period, you retain ownership of the Bonded DOT/KSM and such Bonded DOT/KSM shall remain property of you when bonded. However, for the avoidance of doubt such ownership may be subject to certain additional terms and conditions as amended from time to time, including without limitation the terms and conditions of your smart contract with the Candidate, Parachain Slot Auction, and Base Layer Network.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4. Eligibility.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>You may only use the PSA Services if (i) you fulfill the eligibility criteria of the Terms and (ii) your use of the PSA Services is not prohibited by applicable laws or regulations of the jurisdiction of your residence. Although Payward Trading reserves the right to impose additional eligibility criteria on clients’ use of the PSA Services, which may be described through the Services, these additional restrictions supplement but do not supersede the requirements of the preceding sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5. No Advice, Recommendations, Endorsements, or Guarantees.
        </strong> Without limiting Section 2 of this Addendum:
      </p>
      <p>(a) In connection with the PSA Services, we may make available to you, for your convenience, certain third party information (“PSA Information”). PSA Information includes, without limitation, information relating to any Base Layer Network, parachain, Parachain Slot Auctions and related processes, one or more Candidates, the terms offered by such Candidates (e.g., the Expiration Date of a PSA module, the amount and dates of Reward Tokens to be distributed by Candidates, and other information regarding Candidates’ anticipated parachain network or Reward Tokens). All PSA Information, wherever and however provided, is Third Party Content for purposes of the Terms.
      </p>
      <p>(b) You acknowledge and accept that: (i) we do not guarantee the timeliness, sequence, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or content of PSA Information or related information (e.g., messages disseminated by any Candidate); (ii) PSA Information may be misleading and subject to change, so you should not (and will not) rely on it for any reason; and (iii) all PSA Information is made available by us on an “as-is” basis, without endorsement, as we undertake no duty to investigate the merits or accuracy of any PSA Information, and have no obligation to (and may not) vet any such information.
      </p>
      <p>(c) For each Parachain Slot Auction, we will only be able to support certain Candidates through the PSA Services. This limitation is based on a number of factors and constraints internal to us, and should in no way be interpreted as any form of advice, recommendation, endorsement or guarantee regarding any Candidate, supported or not, the merits of any proposed parachain network or Reward Tokens, or the accuracy or reliability of any claims or information provided by or regarding any of the foregoing.
      </p>
      <p>(d) We do not endorse or recommend Parachain Slot Auctions. We do not and cannot guarantee the outcome of any Parachain Slot Auction or your participation in them. We make no representation or warranty, express or implied, to the full extent not prohibited by applicable law, regarding whether your use of the PSA Services is suitable for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6. Relationships.
        </strong>

      <p>(a) 
        <em>You and Us
        </em>. We do not act in any fiduciary or advisory capacity to you in connection with the PSA Services, and nothing in this Addendum shall be deemed or is intended to be deemed, nor shall it cause, any fiduciary or advisory relationship between you and us to exist. We are not your bank, broker-dealer, tax advisor, or investment adviser and we do not offer these or any related services to you in connection with the PSA Services.
      </p>
      <p>(b) 
        <em>Candidates, You and Us
        </em>. We do not oversee any Candidate’s performance or punctuality, and we have no obligation to investigate, participate, or become involved in any dispute between you and a Candidate. If you experience a problem with a Candidate in connection with the PSA Services, you must resolve the dispute directly with the Candidate. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Payward (and each of our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from any claim, demand, action, damage, loss, cost or expense, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising from or relating to such disputes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7. Risks.
        </strong>
      </p>

      </h2>
      <h3>ADDENDUM: On-Chain Staking Services
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>1.1. General.
        </strong> &nbsp;Payward Trading Ltd, a British Virgin Islands company (
        <strong>“Payward Trading”
        </strong>) provides the option to contribute and earn rewards by participating in on-chain staking, subject to the terms and conditions of this Annex C (this 
        <strong>“Addendum”
        </strong>). &nbsp; These on-chain staking services, as made available by Payward Trading, may be offered to Kraken users that fulfill the eligibility criteria in the Terms of Service. &nbsp;Payward Trading may perform any or all of the Services described in this Addendum directly or through one or more service provider(s).&nbsp;
        <br>
        This Addendum incorporates by reference and supplements the Terms of Service (the 
        <strong>“Terms”
        </strong>). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Terms. In the event of a conflict between the Terms and this Addendum with respect to staking, the terms of this Addendum will control.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>1.2. On-Chain Staking Services.
        </strong> &nbsp;When you buy or hold one of the Digital Assets eligible for staking (the 
        <strong>“Supported Tokens”
        </strong>), you are consenting to such Supported Tokens being staked in part or in entirety by Payward Trading (the 
        <strong>“On-Chain Staking Services”
        </strong>). &nbsp;You retain ownership of the Supported Tokens and such Supported Tokens shall remain property of you when staked under the terms of this Addendum. &nbsp; Please refer to your Kraken Account for further information regarding the On-Chain Staking Services.&nbsp;Section 6.7 of the Terms, which applies to Digital Assets, also applies to Supported Tokens addressed in this paragraph.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.3. Opting into On-Chain Staking Services &amp; On-Chain Staking Reward Terms.
        </strong> &nbsp;In order to use the On-Chain Staking Services, you must opt-in by selecting the Supported Tokens to stake from your Kraken Account. &nbsp;By opting-in a portion or your entire balance of Supported Tokens, Payward Trading shall remit to you the applicable percentage of staking rewards received from the Supported Token protocol attributable to your staked Supported Tokens (
        <strong>“Staking Rewards”
        </strong>) as detailed in your Kraken Account. &nbsp;The applicable percentage and timing of such remittances will: (i) be determined by Payward Trading &nbsp;in its sole discretion; (ii) be subject to Payward Trading’s staking fee; (iii) vary by the Supported Token protocol; and (iv) be further detailed in your Kraken Account. 
        <strong>&nbsp;You agree and understand that neither Payward Trading nor Kraken guarantees that you will receive Staking Rewards and that the applicable percentage (i) is an estimate only and not guaranteed, (ii) may change at any time in Payward Trading’s sole discretion, and (iii) may be more or less than the actual staking rewards Payward Trading receives from the Supported Token protocol.&nbsp;
        </strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>1.4. Slashing Penalty.
        </strong> &nbsp;A determination by the Supported Token protocol that the On-Chain Staking Service has been erroneously operated may result in a “slashing penalty” and non-payment of the applicable Staking Rewards by the Supported Token protocol. &nbsp;Payward Trading agrees to compensate you for any slashing penalties to the extent such penalties are not a result of (i) your acts or omissions, (ii) Supported Token maintenance, bugs, or errors, (iii) acts by a hacker or other malicious actor, or (iv) Force Majeure Events. &nbsp;
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>1.5. No Guarantee of On-Chain Staking Services.
        </strong> While Payward Trading employs measures to ensure that the On-Chain Staking Services are accessible 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, Payward Trading &nbsp;cannot guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation of the On-Chain Staking Services or that Payward Trading will correct all defects or prevent third-party disruptions or unauthorized third party access. &nbsp;In the event of such disruptions, any staked Supported Tokens may not be generating the Staking Rewards.

      </h2>
      <h3>ADDENDUM: Off-chain Staking Services
      </h3>
      <p>Payward Trading Ltd, a British Virgin Islands company (“Payward Trading” and, together with any other Payward entity providing you Services under the Terms (as defined herein), “Kraken,” “we” or “us”) provides you the option to contribute and earn rewards on eligible, available and idle account balances you otherwise maintain in your Kraken Account (the “Off-chain Staking Program”) subject to the terms and conditions of this Annex D (this “Addendum”).
      </p>
      <p>
        <br>
        This Addendum incorporates by reference and supplements the Terms of Service (the “Terms”). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Terms. In the event of a conflict between the Terms and this Addendum with respect to the Off-chain Staking Program, the terms of this Addendum will control.
      </p>
      <p>NO KRAKEN ENTITY IS A BANK OR OTHER DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. YOUR KRAKEN ACCOUNT IS NOT A DEPOSIT ACCOUNT OR A BANK ACCOUNT. THE OFF-CHAIN STAKING PROGRAM IS NOT A DEPOSITORY OR BANK PROGRAM. NEITHER YOUR KRAKEN ACCOUNT NOR STAKED ASSETS (AS DEFINED HEREIN) ARE COVERED BY INSURANCE AGAINST LOSSES OR SUBJECT TO FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (“FDIC”) OR SECURITIES INVESTOR PROTECTION CORPORATION (“SIPC”) PROTECTIONS OR THE PROTECTIONS OF ANY COMPARABLE ORGANIZATION ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1. The Off-chain Staking Program.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>(a) 
        <em>The Off-chain Staking Program is a separate service from the Staking Services described in Annex C to the Terms
        </em>. &nbsp;The Staking Services allow (i) Kraken or a third party acting on Kraken’s behalf to use Supported Coins as collateral in connection with validating transactions on applicable Proof-of-Stake networks and (ii) eligible Kraken clients to opt-in to receive a portion of the rewards generated by these transaction validation activities. The Off-chain Staking Program allows you to contribute Available Assets (as defined herein) to us in exchange for the opportunity to earn Rewards (as defined herein).
      </p>
      <p>(b) 
        <em>Eligible Assets
        </em>. &nbsp;A list of assets that are currently eligible for use in the Off-chain Staking Program is available at 
        <a href="https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002119091-Staking-Funds">https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002119091-Staking-Funds
        </a> (each an “Eligible Asset” and collectively, “Eligible Assets”). We may decide to add or remove assets from the list of Eligible Assets at any time in our sole discretion.
      </p>
      <p>(c) 
        <em>Eligible participants
        </em>. &nbsp;The Off-chain Staking Program may be made available by Kraken to users who fulfill the eligibility criteria of the Terms; provided, however, that you may not use the Off-chain Staking Program if you are located in or a national or resident of any jurisdiction in which Kraken is not authorized to provide the Off-chain Staking Program; or any jurisdiction where your use of the Off-chain Staking Program would be illegal or otherwise violate any applicable law or regulation of that jurisdiction (each of the above locations, a “Restricted Jurisdiction”).
      </p>
      <p>KRAKEN MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY THAT THE OFF-CHAIN STAKING PROGRAM IS APPROPRIATE FOR USE IN ALL LOCATIONS, OR THAT THE TRANSACTIONS AND SERVICES DESCRIBED HEREIN ARE AVAILABLE OR APPROPRIATE FOR ENTRY INTO OR USE IN ALL JURISDICTIONS OR BY ALL PARTIES. YOU SHOULD INFORM YOURSELF AS TO THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND TAX CONSEQUENCES OF USING THE OFF-CHAIN STAKING PROGRAM WITHIN ALL JURISDICTIONS APPLICABLE TO YOU. KRAKEN IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF PARTICIPATING IN THE OFF-CHAIN STAKING PROGRAM.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2. Contributions.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>(a) You may contribute Available Assets to the Off-chain Staking Program by selecting the amount and type of Available Assets you wish to “stake” from your Kraken Account.
      </p>
      <p>(b) You agree to only contribute Eligible Assets to the Off-chain Staking Program that comprise available and idle account balances that you initially deposited into your Kraken Account for the purpose of trading Legal Tender and Digital Assets on the Kraken exchange and not for participation in the Off-chain Staking Program (such Eligible Assets, “Available Assets”).
      </p>
      <p>(c) Assets you contribute to the Off-chain Staking Program (“Staked Assets”) will be treated as received when displayed as such on the Kraken website; provided, that we reserve the right to:&nbsp; (i) reject or remove any contribution from the program; (ii) establish minimum or maximum contribution amounts; or (iii) return any Staked Assets, at any time and in our sole discretion. In the event we elect to return Staked Assets to you pursuant to this Section 2(c), you agree to promptly Unstake (as defined herein) the assets and to undertake any other actions we reasonably request in order to facilitate that return. You may not transfer Staked Assets or any interest in Staked Assets prior to Unstaking those assets.
      </p>
      <p>(d) You remain the lawful and beneficial owner of Staked Assets and the beneficial owner of additional assets resulting from any applicable (i) network fork that is supported by Kraken and (ii) airdrop or similar distribution of Digital Assets that is supported by Kraken; provided, that Kraken retains sole discretion and has no obligation to support any particular forks, airdrops or similar distribution and such support remains in all instances subject to the Terms.&nbsp;Section 6.7 of the Terms, which applies to Digital Assets, also applies to Staked Assets and Digital Assets addressed in this paragraph.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3. Rewards.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>(a) You may earn rewards on Staked Assets (“Rewards”). Rewards are not guaranteed and the rates and timing of Rewards may vary.
      </p>
      <p>(b) Rewards, if any, will be paid to you by Payward Trading, and shall be subject to tax withholding and reporting as required by applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>(c) Reward rates will be determined in our sole discretion based on the type of Staked Asset, market conditions and risk factors. Such rates have no relationship to and may not be competitive with benchmark interest rates observed in the market for bank deposit accounts.
      </p>
      <p>(d) We may make available anticipated Reward rates and payment schedules from time to time on or through the Services (“Anticipated Rates”). Anticipated Rates are forward-looking statements that reflect current expectations regarding future events, involve significant risks and uncertainties, should not be read as guarantees of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of whether or not such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are in no way a form of advice, solicitation or offering of or for the Off-chain Staking Program and should not be interpreted as such.
      </p>
      <p>(e) All Rewards will be (i) paid to your Kraken Account in the same asset as the applicable Staked Asset, then (ii) automatically contributed to the Off-chain Staking Program, whereupon they will be eligible to earn Rewards. In this manner, Rewards may be described as “compounding.”
      </p>
      <p>(f) Rewards will be calculated and paid with the decimal precision described at 
        <a href="https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002119091-Staking-Funds">https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002119091-Staking-Funds
        </a>, as may be updated by us from time to time in our sole discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4. Unstaking.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>(a) You may request a complete or partial return of your Staked Assets (“Unstake”) at any time. Upon receipt of your request, we will initiate the Unstaking process instantly when practicable; provided, that we may require up to seven days after you submit your request to Unstake to process the transaction. Unstaking limits based on frequency or volume may apply from time to time and will be described on or through the Services.
      </p>
      <p>(b) You must Unstake Staked Assets before you will be able to push those Funds to an External Account.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5. Our use of Staked Assets.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>You grant us the right, to the fullest extent that we may effectively do so under applicable law and without further notice to you, to utilize Staked Assets in our discretion; provided, that the quantity and type of your Staked Assets will be returned to you when you Unstake in accordance with the terms of this Addendum.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6. Risks.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>The Off-chain Staking Program is risky. Before participating in the Off-chain Staking Program, it is important to understand its specific and unique risks. The Staking Program is not for everyone. You should examine your objectives, financial resources and risk tolerance to determine whether contributing Funds to the Off-chain Staking Program is appropriate for you. Some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Off-chain Staking Program are:
      </p>
      <p>(a) No Kraken entity is or is regulated as a bank or other depository institution. Your Kraken Account is not a deposit account or a bank account. The Off-chain Staking Program is not a depository or bank program. Staked Assets are not covered by insurance against losses or subject to FDIC or SIPC protections or the protections of any comparable organization anywhere in the world.
      </p>
      <p>(b) Kraken does not offer securities services, is not registered under the securities laws of any jurisdiction and the provision of the Off-chain Staking Program has not been and will not be registered under the securities laws of any jurisdiction or otherwise approved by securities regulators in any jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>(c) Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal or international level may adversely affect:&nbsp; (i) the use, transfer, and value of Staked Assets; (ii) the operations and profitability of the Off-chain Staking Program; (iii) the tax treatment of the Off-chain Staking Program; and (iv) your ability to Unstake Staked Assets in a timely manner or at all.
      </p>
      <p>(d) Rewards for Staked Assets are not guaranteed and we reserve the right to adjust Reward rates in our sole discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7. Fees.

      <h3>ADDENDUM: Instant Buy/Sell Services (“Instant Buy/Sell Addendum”)
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>1.1 General.
        </strong> Kraken may make the Instant Buy/Sell Services, which include the order types in this Instant Buy/Sell Addendum, available to users that meet the eligibility criteria in the Terms of Service. Your use of the Instant Buy/Sell Services, confirms that you have read, understand, and accept all of the terms in this Instant Buy/Sell Addendum. This Instant Buy/Sell Addendum is subject to the full Terms of Service, including the ACH &amp; CC Addendum (Annex F), as they may be updated from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.2 Instant Buy/Sell Services.
        </strong> You may use the Instant Buy/Sell Services to buy, sell, or convert between Digital Assets and/or Legal Tender. Your use of the Instant Buy/Sell Services must comply with the relevant instructions on the Kraken platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.3 Transaction Price.
        </strong> You will be presented with a price valid only during a specific time period when initiating a transaction. Kraken may cancel any transaction not confirmed by you within the time period.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.4 Fees.
        </strong> Transactions using the Instant Buy/Sell Services are subject to fees and you understand that applicable transaction fees may change. Our current fees can be found in the 
        <a href="/features/fee-schedule">Fee Schedule
        </a> under the Instant Buy tab. You are presented with the applicable fees charged by us before entering into the transaction. Your confirmation of the transaction constitutes agreement to pay all such applicable fees. You will not be charged any such fees in the unlikely event your transaction is rejected.
      </p>
      <p>Your payment provider may charge additional fees in conjunction with your transaction, however we do not know the fees charged by your payment provider. You understand and agree that you are fully responsible for your payment providers’ fees for all transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.5 No Guarantee of Instant Buy/Sell Services.
        </strong> While Kraken employs measures to ensure that the Instant Buy/Sell Services are accessible 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, Kraken cannot guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Instant Buy/Sell Services or that Kraken will correct all defects or prevent third-party disruptions or unauthorized third party access. Kraken may at its sole discretion reject any pending transaction, whether confirmed by the user or not, in the event of such disruptions. Kraken bears no liability for rejecting an Instant Buy/Sell transaction.
      </p>
      <p>If Kraken cannot complete your transaction for any reason (such as price movement, failure of the Kraken platform to respond, or an order exceeding the minimum or maximum order size), Kraken may reject the order and notify you of such rejection. Kraken bears no liability for rejecting an Instant Buy/Sell transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.6 Payment Methods.
        </strong> If you select a credit card or wallet as your payment method for any Instant Buy/Sell Services, and such transaction falls on a weekend or holiday, or after business hours, the debit may be executed on the next business day, although the transaction fees at the time of the transaction will apply. If your payment method fails we will notify you of cancellation of the transaction and may use the remedies set forth in the Terms, including any applicable addendum, to recover any amount owed to Kraken. You agree to keep your payment method updated as long as you have any active or scheduled transactions as part of the Instant Buy/Sell Services, including any recurring or custom order transactions. Kraken may, at any time and without liability: (i) &nbsp;suspend, or delay any transaction offered as an Instant Buy/Sell Service, including any recurring or custom order transactions, without notice; and (ii) &nbsp;terminate any transaction offered as an Instant Buy/Sell Service by providing notice to you, unless such notice is prohibited by law.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.7 Custom Order Transactions.
        </strong> While Kraken will attempt to fulfill custom orders at the chosen price once the custom order is triggered, there is no guarantee that the order will execute at the price chosen in the custom order and the custom order may not execute immediately after the custom order is triggered.
      </p>
      <p>​​If you initiate custom order transactions, you authorize us to initiate the elected custom order electronic purchase or sale using Funds in accordance with your selected custom order and any corresponding payment accounts, if applicable. This authorization will remain in full force and effect until you cancel the custom order, the custom order is executed, or Kraken rejects the custom order per Section 1.5 above. Changes in your custom order settings may take up to one day to become effective.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.8 Recurring Transactions.
        </strong> If you initiate recurring transactions, you authorize us to initiate recurring electronic purchases or sales using Funds in accordance with your selected transaction and any corresponding payment accounts, if applicable. This authorization will remain in full force and effect until you change your recurring transaction setting in your account settings, under “Recurring Orders” on your account screen. You may cancel any future recurring charges that you schedule in your Kraken Account at least one business day prior to the date of the next scheduled transaction as changes in your recurring transaction settings may take up to one day. Cancellations placed less than 1 day prior may not be honored. Your recurring transactions will occur based on your period selection (e.g., daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly), until you or Kraken cancels the recurring transaction pursuant to these Terms. Recurring transactions scheduled for the 29th, 30th, or 31st day of a month will be processed the earlier of the date scheduled or on the last day of the applicable month. For example, recurring transactions scheduled for the 31st will be processed on the 30th in April, June, September, and November. &nbsp;We will attempt to execute your recurring transaction on the day that you select, however transaction times may vary. You understand and agree that the amount of any digital asset you purchase or sell in each recurring transaction will depend on the market price at the time of the transaction and will only be determined once the transaction is executed. You should regularly check the status of your recurring transactions. Kraken will not verify the information or details of your recurring transactions. You agree that the information and details of your recurring transactions as provided by you are accurate and complete and as such may be treated and acted upon by Kraken.

      <h2>Annex F
      </h2>
      <h3>ADDENDUM: ACH &amp; Credit Card Funding Methods (the “ACH and CC Addendum”)
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>1.1 "Verified External Account"
        </strong> means any account other than your Kraken Account(s) of which you are the beneficial owner. This includes, but is not limited to, payment service accounts, deposit or checking accounts maintained by financial institutions, or Digital Asset/NFT Accounts, of which you are the owner. Verified External Accounts may be used to make deposits into your Kraken Account, or to withdraw Assets from your Kraken Account. Periodically, we may require you to verify that your account complies with any and all Kraken AML/KYC requirements.&nbsp;You authorize Kraken to initiate debits and credits on Verified External Accounts that you connect to your Kraken Account.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.2 General.
        </strong> Kraken may permit you to fund your Kraken Account or directly purchase Digital Assets or NFTs using ACH and/or a credit card. Your funding of your Kraken Account by ACH and/or credit card or use of ACH and/or credit card to purchase a Digital Asset or NFT, confirms that you have read, understand, and accept all of the terms in this ACH and CC Addendum. This ACH and CC Addendum is subject to the terms and conditions, as they may be updated from time to time, set forth in the Terms of Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.3 ACH Funding Method.
        </strong> You may fund your Kraken Account or directly purchase Digital Assets or NFTs from a Verified External Account using ACH. Your use of the ACH funding method must comply with any instructions presented to you on the Kraken platform. Your linked account will be debited when you initiate payment. Your Kraken Account may not, however, reflect credit immediately after you initiate payment.
      </p>
      <p>ACH transfers may be delayed. A contracted third party processor or Kraken may reject the ACH transfer. Kraken is not liable for any delayed or rejected ACH transfer. Funding by ACH is subject to all terms and conditions set forth by your financial institution, and you may incur fees that are charged by your financial institution in conjunction with such funding.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.4 Credit Card Funding Method.
        </strong> You may fund your Kraken Account or directly purchase Digital Assets or NFTs from a Verified External Account using a credit card. Your use of the credit card funding method must comply with any instructions presented to you on the Kraken exchange. Your credit card payments may be delayed, or rejected. Delay may occur from, among other things, payment processing timing issues; your credit card company, a third party processor or Kraken may reject your credit card payment. It is your responsibility to monitor your Kraken account in respect of credit card funding. Kraken will not be liable to you for any losses, fees or charges in connection with use of the Credit Card Funding Method. Funding by credit card is, in addition to the terms set forth herein, subject to any applicable terms set forth in your credit card agreement, which may include fees charged by your credit card in conjunction with such funding.
      </p>
      <p>You are liable for any credited amounts in case of a chargeback. If you have set up recurring payments, you irrevocably waive the right to obtain pre-notifications before payments are made. If payment is not possible (e.g., your credit card company declines or rejects the payment), or a chargeback occurs, you will bear any resulting costs (including the original chargeback amount) and you authorize Kraken to execute the payment again at a later time. Each attempted execution is subject to the fees set forth in Section 9 of the Terms of Service. You authorize and grant Kraken the right to deduct costs and fees directly from any assets in your Kraken account without notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.5 Withdrawals.
        </strong> Kraken reserves the right to require that your Kraken Account holds sufficient Funds to cover 1:1 any deposit or Digital Asset or NFT purchase using ACH or credit card for 120 days post deposit (“Unsecured Deposit Hold’). Your Kraken Account will indicate if such Unsecured Deposit Hold is required. We may permit you to use such Funds to buy, sell, or trade, or in connection with Margin Trading, but you may not withdraw such Funds prior to the resolution of the Unsecured Deposit Hold.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.6 Plaid ACH Funding.
        </strong> If you are based in the United States, you agree that, if applicable, with your prior authorization, Kraken may use Plaid, Inc. (“Plaid”) to connect your Kraken Account with your bank account (each bank account connected being a Verified External Account). &nbsp;You are able to connect your Kraken Account to your bank account via Plaid on the “Funding” page of our website. Your authorization to initiate debits and credits on bank account(s) that you have connected on the “Funding” page of our website will remain in full force and effect until you terminate the authorization by deleting your bank account from the “manage deposit accounts” section of the “Funding” page of our website. &nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>It is your responsibility to verify your bank account, and confirm adequate funds are available prior to approving a transaction. Information you share with Plaid is treated in accordance with its End User Privacy Policy, available at 
        <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://plaid.com/legal/#end-user-privacy-policy">https://plaid.com/legal/#end-user-privacy-policy
        </a> (“Plaid’s Privacy Policy”). You agree that the terms and conditions of Plaid’s Privacy Policy will govern Plaid’s use of such information, and by using Plaid you agree to the terms and conditions of Plaid’s Privacy Policy. You expressly grant Plaid the right, power, and authority to access and transmit your information as reasonably necessary for Plaid to provide its services to you in connection with your use of the Kraken Exchange.

Kraken may implement parameters that affect search and sort results; accordingly, a particular NFT listing may not appear in some search and browse results regardless of the search inquiry or sort option(s) chosen by the user. We reserve the right to adjust these search and sorting parameters at any time in our sole discretion, without notice, including, without limitation, through automated means.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>(b)&nbsp;
        <em>Rarity scores and rankings.&nbsp;

We do not make any guarantees or warranties regarding the accuracy, consistency, or value of any of the scores or rankings on the NFT Services, all of which are subject to the disclaimers set forth in Section 9 of this Addendum.

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4. Storage and web3 Connectivity.&nbsp;
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>(a) 
        <em>General.
        </em>&nbsp; You may use your NFTs through the NFT Services by either (i) depositing such&nbsp; NFTs for storage by us on your behalf, by transferring them to your Kraken Account, or (ii) by connecting a supported, self-hosted wallet (such as your Metamask wallet) that allows you to access the NFTs in an External Account that you control (a “web3 Wallet”).
      </p>
      <p>(b) 
        <em>Risks and disclaimer
        </em>.&nbsp; Whether you choose to use your NFTs on the NFT Services by transferring your NFTs to deposit them in your Kraken Account or by connecting a web3 Wallet, you acknowledge there are risks associated with storing NFTs on or connecting your web3 Wallet to the NFT Services, including, but not limited to, the risk of malicious software introduction, the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to your third-party wallet or account, and the risk of theft of NFTs. Certain technological difficulties experienced by Kraken may also prevent the access to or use of your NFTs.
        <br>
        <br>
        With respect to the use of web3 Wallets, Kraken accepts no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with your use of a web3 Wallet and makes no representations or warranties regarding how the NFT Services will operate with any specific web3 Wallet. You are solely responsible for keeping your web3 Wallet secure and you should never share your web3 Wallet credentials, private key or seed phrase with anyone. If you discover an issue related to your web3 Wallet, please contact your wallet provider. Likewise, you are solely responsible for your Kraken Account and any associated web3 Wallet and we are not, and will not be, liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with your Kraken Account or as a result of your Kraken Account or web3 Wallet being compromised.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>(c) 
        <em>Ownership and risk of loss. 
        </em>Section 6.7 of the Terms, which applies to Digital Assets, also applies to NFTs in your Kraken Account. Additionally,
        <em> 
        </em>by using this platform, you represent and agree that you are the lawful owner of any NFT that you (a) attempt to sell on this platform, (b) store in your Kraken Account, or (c) store in a connected web3 Wallet. At no point shall ownership of any such NFTs transfer to Kraken. You bear the risks of loss for any such NFTs, regardless of where you store those NFTs. Except as required by a facially valid court order, or except as provided herein, Kraken will not sell, transfer, loan or otherwise alienate your NFTs unless instructed by you or as otherwise authorized by this Addendum or the Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, Kraken makes no representations to any party that any NFT is free and clear of any security interest or other lien or encumbrance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>(d) 
        <em>Control.
        </em>&nbsp;Section 6.7 of the Terms, which applies to Digital Assets, also applies to NFTs in your Kraken Account. Additionally, you control the NFTs held in your Kraken Account. At any time, subject to outages, downtime, this Addendum, the Terms, and other applicable policies, you may withdraw your NFTs from your Kraken Account by transferring them to an External Account. Similarly, we do not control the NFTs held in your External Accounts and, subject to outages, downtime, this Addendum, the Terms, and other applicable policies, you may disconnect a web3 Wallet from the NFT Services at any time.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>(e) 
        <em>Supplemental benefits and access.
        </em>&nbsp; The NFT Services may not support all features, functionalities or benefits of each NFT that is supported by the NFT Services (“Supported NFTs”), and may not, for example, include support for any other protocols and/or functionality which supplement or interact with the Supported NFTs. Such exclusions may include, but are not limited to, ‘forked’ protocols, airdropped Digital Assets or NFTs, or other functionality such as staking, protocol governance, access to community perks, and/or any smart contract functionality, which may supplement or interact with a Supported NFT (“Supplemental Benefits”). Determinations whether to support any Supplemental Benefit shall be made by Kraken in our sole discretion, and without liability to us. Kraken shall not be responsible or liable for your inability to receive or enjoy Supplemental Benefits of your NFTs during the time when they are stored in a Kraken Account.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </p>
      <p>(a) 
        <em>General.&nbsp; 
        </em>Through the NFT Services, Kraken provides an administrative platform that facilitates clients’ ability to offer, bid on, buy and sell NFTs from one another or from Kraken using a variety of pricing and transaction formats (the “NFT Marketplace”). When you purchase an NFT on the NFT Marketplace, Kraken facilitates the transfer of ownership of the applicable NFT from the counterparty to you by registering you as the owner of the purchased NFT on Kraken’s internal book-entry system.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>(b) 
        <em>Authorization
        </em>. When you submit an offer, bid, purchase, sale, or transfer request via the NFT Marketplace, you authorize Kraken to execute the transaction and charge you any applicable fees (as described in the Terms).&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>(c) 
        <em>Independent relationship. 
        </em>You acknowledge and agree that (i) Kraken is not acting as your broker, intermediary, agent, or advisor or in any fiduciary capacity, and (ii) no communication or information provided to you by Kraken shall be considered or construed as investment, tax, or any other form of advice in connection with your use of the NFT Services.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>(d) 
        <em>Valuations.
        </em> From time to time Kraken may display estimates of the value of NFTs on the NFT Marketplace, including but not limited to: (i) the floor price of an NFT collection, which is approximated by reference to the lowest priced NFT sold or offered for sale within that collection; (ii) the estimated value of an NFT listed on the NFT Marketplace; and (iii) the aggregate estimated value of NFTs in your Kraken Account or web3 Wallet. You understand that the value of NFTs is subjective, that these estimated values are provided for illustrative purposes only, and that this information is not a guarantee of execution at that, or any, price. Moreover, you understand and agree that this information may differ from prevailing sale prices made available via other sources outside of the NFT Marketplace and are not guarantees of the sale prices that will actually be available on the NFT Marketplace.
      </p>
      <p>(e) 
        <em>Payment method-specific additional terms.
        </em>&nbsp; You acknowledge and agree that: (i) when using Instant Buy/Sell Services on the NFT Marketplace, you are subject to the terms detailed in Annex E (the Instant Buy/Sell Addendum), and (ii) when using ACH and credit card funding methods on the NFT Marketplace, you are subject to the terms detailed in Annex F (the ACH and CC Addendum). &nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>(f) 
        <em>Transfer confirmation.
        </em> Once the NFT Marketplace executes a transfer of ownership of the applicable NFT, a confirmation will be electronically made available via the NFT Services detailing the particulars of the transfer. You acknowledge and agree that the failure of the NFT Services to provide such confirmation shall not prejudice or invalidate the terms of such transfer.
      </p>
      <p>(g) 
        <em>Creator Earnings. 
        </em>&nbsp;Kraken may, in its discretion, elect to collect and facilitate the payment of a portion of NFT sale or resale proceeds to parties that are not sellers or resellers of the NFT (“Creator Earnings''). Such parties are expressly not third party beneficiaries under this Addendum. With respect to any sale of an NFT on the NFT Marketplace, Kraken may, in its discretion, elect to (i) either (a) deduct, from the sale proceeds of such NFT that otherwise would be paid to the seller of such NFT, the Creator Earnings that Kraken determines are applicable to such sale, or (b) collect from the seller of such NFT the Creator Earnings that Kraken determines are applicable to such sale, and (ii) pay such Creator Earnings to eligible recipients as contemplated by Section 5(h) below. While Kraken may consider publicly accessible sources such as the data associated with a given NFT’s underlying smart contract, Third-Party NFT Purchase Terms, blockchain transaction histories, and other information in determining the amount, timing, and beneficiaries of Creator Earnings, all such determinations shall be made by Kraken in its sole discretion. Where Creator Earnings are collected in the form of transaction fees or deductions from sale proceeds on the NFT Marketplace, you will be informed of the applicable amount of Creator Earnings to be collected through the NFT Services. Kraken will not be liable for any Creator Earnings deducted or collected in connection with the sale of an NFT, and will not have any obligation to any party to collect or remit Creator Earnings.&nbsp; &nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>(h) 
        <em>Claiming Creator Earnings.&nbsp; 
        </em>In order to claim Creator Earnings, eligible persons must complete the actions requested via the NFT Services, which may include creating a Kraken Account and/or providing any information requested by Kraken in connection with such account creation and/or claims. By claiming any Creator Earnings with respect to an NFT resale, you (i) represent that you have the right to receive such Creator Earnings with respect to such NFT resale, and (ii) agree that if Kraken determines that any Creator Earnings were erroneously paid to you, you will promptly return such Creator Earnings to Kraken.
      </p>
      <p>(i) 
        <em>NFT-specific terms and conditions.&nbsp;
        </em>
      </p>
      <p class="indent-1">(i) 
        <em>NFT sellers. 
        </em>When you sell an NFT on the NFT Marketplace, you represent and warrant that you have all right and title to such NFT and that you have the right to display and sell such NFT on the NFT Marketplace. If you are the creator of such NFT, you agree that you will not replicate, in its entirety, the content incorporated into the NFT for the creation of additional NFTs. If you purchased an NFT from a third party prior to depositing the NFT into your Kraken Account, you agree that by selling the NFT on the NFT Marketplace you are selling all of your right and title to such NFT.
      </p>
      <p class="indent-1">(ii) 
        <em>NFT buyers. 
        </em>When you purchase an NFT on the NFT Marketplace, your rights and obligations with respect to such NFT, and the content and benefits associated with such NFT, may be subject to and governed by third-party terms and conditions under which the seller is reselling the NFT or the original minter of the NFT initially distributed the NFT (the “Third-Party NFT Purchase Terms”). Kraken is not a party to any such Third-Party NFT Purchase Terms, which are solely between the buyer and the seller (or the original minter, as applicable). It is your sole responsibility to, prior to purchasing any NFT, independently identify, read and understand the Third-Party NFT Purchase Terms that apply to such NFT (e.g., by viewing such Third-Party NFT Purchase Terms on the official website of the developer, content creator and/or minter).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>(j) 
        <em>Smart contracts. 
        </em>You acknowledge that your interactions with an NFT and the behavior of an NFT may be dependent on, or dictated by, a third-party smart contract that governs the NFT. You are solely responsible for understanding the applicable smart contract and verifying whether it operates as you expect it to. Kraken shall not be responsible or liable for any defects in, or unexpected behavior of, any smart contract associated with an NFT, or any losses that you suffer as a result thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6. Supported NFTs. 
        </strong>The determination as to which NFTs and NFT collections will be Supported NFTs will be made by Kraken in its sole discretion. Such determinations shall not constitute or be construed as financial or investment advice, investment or purchase recommendations, or a solicitation to buy or sell. Kraken reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to remove or restrict access to any NFT listings, scores, rankings and/or other content or information from the NFT Services at any time if Kraken believes that (a) misrepresentations have been made regarding any of such content, or (b) the continued inclusion of such content on the NFT Services would (i) infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party, (ii) violate any applicable law, rule or regulation, (iii) violate this Addendum or the Terms, (iv) expose Kraken or its affiliates to liability or potential liability, (v) tarnish or damage Kraken’s, its affiliates’ or the NFT Services’ reputation, brand or image, or (vi) be otherwise undesirable.&nbsp; Under no circumstances shall the inability to view NFTs on the NFT Services or an inability to use the NFT Services in conjunction with the purchase, sale, or transfer of NFTs available on any blockchains serve as grounds for a claim against Kraken.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7. Third Parties.&nbsp;
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>(a) 
        <em>Third Party Content and Services.
        </em>&nbsp; In using our NFT Services, you may view NFTs or other content provided by third parties, including, without limitation, links to web pages of third parties (collectively, “Third Party Content and Services”). We do not control, endorse or adopt any Third Party Content and Services and shall have no responsibility for Third Party Content and Services, including, without limitation, material that may be infringing, illegal, misleading, incomplete, erroneous, offensive, indecent or otherwise objectionable. In addition, your business dealings or correspondence with such third parties are solely between you and the third parties. When you click on a link to or access and use Third Party Content and Services, although we may not warn you that you have left our Services, you are subject to the terms and conditions (including privacy policies) of another website or destination. We are not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings, and you understand that your viewing and use of Third Party Content and Services, and your interactions with third parties, are at your own risk.
      </p>
      <p>(b) 
        <em>Third Party Disputes.
        </em>&nbsp; In the event of a disagreement arising between you and any other user of the NFT Services or third party, Kraken will not provide dispute resolution services and the parties must resolve such disputes directly. If you have a dispute with one or more users of the NFT Services or third parties, you release us from claims, demands, and damages of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. In entering into this release you expressly waive any protections (whether statutory or otherwise) that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>8. Risks.&nbsp; 
        </strong>You accept and acknowledge, without limitation, that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The fact that an NFT is blockchain-based and transfers of an NFT can be verifiable does not mean that the minter or seller of an NFT has the rights necessary to grant you rights and licenses with respect to the content associated with the NFT, and you are solely responsible for ascertaining whether your purchase of an NFT will validly and effectively acquire for you the rights and licenses you expect to receive by virtue of such purchase;
        </li>
        <li>The price and liquidity of blockchain assets, including, without limitation, NFTs, are extremely volatile and subjective and may be subject to large fluctuations. You acknowledge that you fully understand this inherent volatility and the subjective value of NFTs and that you may lose money;&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect NFTs, which may also be subject to significant price volatility;&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, NFTs, cryptocurrency, and other crypto-based items is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange and value of NFTs;
        </li>
        <li>A lack of continued use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility of NFTs;
        </li>
        <li>Transactions in NFTs may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable;&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>We do not control certain smart contracts and protocols that may be integral to your ability to complete NFT transactions;
        </li>
        <li>Defects, errors or unanticipated features of a smart contract governing an NFT may result in unexpected behaviors and results with respect to the NFT, which may include, without limitation, inability to access or transfer the NFT;
        </li>
        <li>Changes to Third Party Content and Services (discussed above) may create a risk that your access to and use of the NFT Services will suffer; and
        </li>
        <li>You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your NFT-related transactions. We are not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the NFT Services.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You are solely responsible for determining the nature, potential value, suitability, and appropriateness of these risks for yourself.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>9. Disclaimers
        </strong>.
      </p>
      <p>NOTHING ON OR INVOLVING THE NFT SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RARITY SCORES AND RANKINGS, SHALL CONSTITUTE OR BE CONSTRUED AS FINANCIAL OR INVESTMENT ADVICE, INVESTMENT OR PURCHASE RECOMMENDATIONS, OR A SOLICITATION TO BUY OR SELL.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>THE VALUE OF AN NFT IS SUBJECTIVE. PRICES OF NFTS ARE SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY AND ANY RARITY SCORES AND RANKINGS, OR ESTIMATED MARKET VALUES, DISPLAYED ON THE NFT SERVICES ARE NOT A REFLECTION OF OR A PROXY FOR ACTUAL VALUE OR A GUARANTEE OF SALE PRICES THAT CAN ACTUALLY BE OBTAINED. THE RARITY SCORES AND RANKINGS ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE RELIED ON AND WE SHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY NFT PURCHASES MADE BY YOU.
      </p>
      <p>KRAKEN’S NFT SERVICES HELP YOU EXPLORE NFTS CREATED BY VARIOUS CREATORS AND INTERACT WITH DIFFERENT BLOCKCHAINS. KRAKEN DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT ANY THIRD-PARTY CONTENT VISIBLE THROUGH THE NFT SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY CONTENT ASSOCIATED WITH NFTS DISPLAYED ON THE SERVICE.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>YOU BEAR FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR VERIFYING THE IDENTITY, LEGITIMACY, AND AUTHENTICITY OF NFTS THAT YOU PURCHASE FROM THIRD PARTIES USING THE NFT SERVICES AND WE MAKE NO CLAIMS ABOUT THE IDENTITY, LEGITIMACY, FUNCTIONALITY, OR AUTHENTICITY OF USERS OR NFTS (AND ANY CONTENT ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH NFTS) VISIBLE ON THE NFT SERVICES.
      </p>
      <p>WE ALSO CANNOT, AND DO NOT, GUARANTEE THAT ANY NFTS VISIBLE ON THE NFT SERVICES WILL ALWAYS REMAIN VISIBLE AND/OR AVAILABLE TO BE BOUGHT, SOLD, OR TRANSFERRED.
      </p>
      <p>ALTHOUGH NFTS ARE GENERALLY INTENDED TO BE NON-FUNGIBLE TOKENS REPRESENTING A UNIQUE, NON-INTERCHANGEABLE UNIT OF DATA, CERTAIN NFTS MAY BE FUNGIBLE WITH ONE ANOTHER. THERE CAN BE NO, AND WE DO NOT MAKE ANY, GUARANTEE OR ASSURANCE OF THE UNIQUENESS, ORIGINALITY OR QUALITY OF ANY NFT ON THE NFT SERVICES.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10. Intellectual Property.
        </strong> &nbsp; Kraken respects the valid intellectual property rights of others. Each user must ensure that the materials they provide do not infringe any third-party rights, including, without limitation, copyrights. We will respond to allegations of U.S. copyright infringement with respect to content or other materials on the NFT Services in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, 17 U.S.C. § 512 (the “DMCA”) when we receive valid takedown notices submitted to us in accordance with the DMCA (“DMCA Notices”) and similarly valid counter notices (“DMCA Counter Notices”).

      <p>
        <strong>6. Additional Risks
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>In addition to any previously disclosed risks in the Terms, you understand that: &nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>(a) Digital Assets are not legal tender or backed by a government;
      </p>
      <p>(b) There is no established procedure for establishing the value of Digital Assets. The methodology for valuing virtual assets is nascent, and there may be disagreement amongst investors, some of whom may argue that Digital Assets have no value. You should ensure that you fully understand the characteristics of any particular Digital Asset before investing;
      </p>
      <p>(c) The value of any given Digital Asset may be unpredictable. Relative to Legal Tender the value of any Digital Asset may be uncertain and subject to volatility. You should be prepared for prices to fluctuate up to 10% per day, or more;
      </p>
      <p>(d) Trading in Digital Assets may be susceptible to irrational market forces, and it may not always be clear why the market is moving in a particular direction;
      </p>
      <p>(e) The character of Digital Assets is such that it may lead to an increased risk of financial crime;
      </p>
      <p>(f) Given the character of Digital Assets there may be an increased risk of cyberattack, and in the event of a cyberattack you may not be able to access your Digital Assets and/or the value of those Digital Assets may be diminished;
      </p>
      <p>(g) There may be limited or no means for the recovery of lost or stolen Digital Assets. If you send your Digital Assets to an incorrect wallet address, it may be impossible for you to recover those Digital Assets;
      </p>
      <p>(h) Digital Assets may be transacted by means of new technologies, (including for example distributed ledger technologies (‘DLT’)) and may in the future include technologies not known to exist today. Such new novel technologies may adversely affect Digital Assets, and may result in such things as anonymity of ownership, irreversibility of transactions, accidental transactions, and concerns regarding transaction recording, and settlement;
      </p>
      <p>(i) Even though a party may accept a Digital Asset as payment today, it is possible that the same party or any other party may not accept a Digital Asset as payment in the future. For example, some merchants that accept certain Digital Assets today (such as Bitcoin and Ether) may not accept them in the future; and
      </p>
      <p>(j) You may not have access or use of your Digital Assets due to technological difficulties affecting the Kraken exchange.
      </p>
      <p>

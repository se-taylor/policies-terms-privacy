We will calculate the miner fees at our discretion, although we will always notify you of the miner fees at (or before) the time you authorise the Digital Asset Transaction. When you or a third party sends Digital Assets to an Account from an external wallet not hosted on the Platform, the person initiating the transaction is solely responsible for executing the transaction properly, which may include, among other things, payment of miner fees in order for the transaction to be completed successfully. Non-payment of miner fees may cause your Transaction to remain in a pending state outside of our control and we are not responsible for delays or loss incurred as a result of an error in the initiation of the transaction and have no obligation to assist in the remediation of such Transactions.

A Transaction is not complete while it is in a pending state.

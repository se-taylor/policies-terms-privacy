Specifically, you further agree and understand that all Mobile Orders either: (i) execute against a principal market maker that is a Gemini Service Provider and affiliate (the “Liquidity Provider”), or (ii) are placed and, if conditions allow, executed on your behalf on our Exchange by the Liquidity Provider as an agency broker.

Similarly, you agree and understand that the Liquidity Provider may reject any Mobile Order if it is unable to execute it on your behalf on our Exchange as an agency broker due to the market price moving such that the Mobile Order cannot be executed at or better than the specified price, the Mobile Order exceeds the maximum Mobile Order size limit on our Exchange, or Downtime. In any event, and absent unexpected technological interruptions or Downtime, a Mobile Order will not be pending for more than 60 seconds; that is, you will generally receive either a notice of execution or a notice of rejection within 60 seconds of placing a Mobile Order. You further agree and understand that the Liquidity Provider will be the exclusive counterparty to or agent for all Mobile Orders, as applicable, and that the affiliation between the Liquidity Provider and Gemini gives rise to certain potential or actual conflicts of interest. Without limitation, these conflicts include the fact that we have not established and do not intend to establish relationships with unaffiliated liquidity providers, for purposes of the Mobile Application, regardless of whether the terms and fees offered by such unaffiliated liquidity providers are more favorable to users of the Mobile Application. In addition, we may share various resources with the Liquidity Provider, including, but not limited to, office space, personnel, and systems.

If at any time you are in any doubt about the status of your Order, you can view your Order status on Gemini. We may cancel any Order flagged for review.

You further agree and understand that we do not guarantee that you will receive the best possible rate (as compared to prices that may be possible on other execution venues) on the execution of any FX transactions. You further agree and understand that the price quoted to you on the Exchange for the Digital Asset transaction may include, amongst other components, the spread charged by the FX provider.

A simple assertion that a mistake was made by you in entering an Order, or that you failed to pay attention to or update an Order, is not sufficient to establish it as a Clearly Erroneous Transaction.

          <span>We accept Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) deposits from User Bank Accounts. ACH deposits are made available for trading immediately; however, we reserve the right to hold funds in the amount of the ACH deposit and/or Digital Assets sufficient to cover the funds, which may exceed the amount of funds from the ACH deposit based on Gemini’s assessment of potential fluctuations of the price of such Digital Assets, and to prevent withdrawal until the ACH deposit is considered settled (typically within four to five Business Days). Once your ACH deposit is considered settled, you will be able to withdraw these funds and any such Digital Assets. You agree and understand that ACH deposit settlement times are subject to bank holidays, the internal processes and jurisdiction of your bank, and the internal processes of our Banks. You further agree and understand that in certain situations, ACH deposit settlement times may be delayed in connection with Downtime or disruptions to Gemini Service Providers. If your ACH deposit is returned to your bank or fails for any other reason, Gemini reserves the right to avail itself of remedies set forth in this User Agreement to recover any amount owed to Gemini, including the right to cancel or reverse any transaction, including orders, made in reliance on or in expectation of receipt of the deposited funds, and to seize Digital Assets purchased in reliance on or in expectation of receipt of the deposited funds. In this instance, you have no right to any Digital Assets or other assets purchased in reliance on or in expectation or receipt of the deposited funds, nor will Gemini have an obligation to allow you to reinstate a purchase or other order at the same price or on the same terms as the cancelled or reversed transaction. In such instances, we have the right to retain any seized funds, including any appreciation thereof.

You and Gemini expressly agree that any dispute about the scope of this User Agreement to arbitrate and/or the arbitrability of any particular dispute shall be resolved in arbitration in accordance with this section. You and Gemini expressly agree that an arbitrator may issue all appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief necessary to ensure the arbitration of disputes (but only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim). You and Gemini agree to keep any arbitration strictly confidential.

Any such co-defendant or defendant is a third-party beneficiary entitled to enforce this arbitration provision.

    <span>You and Gemini agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, low-cost, and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (“Dispute Notice”). Any Dispute Notice to Gemini must be sent to support@gemini.com (“Notice Address”). Any Dispute Notice to you by Gemini will be sent to the email address registered with your Gemini Account. Any Dispute Notice must include: (a) the name, address, and email address of the party providing the Dispute Notice; (b) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, including any relevant facts regarding Gemini or your use of Gemini; (c) an explanation of the specific relief sought, including the total damages sought, if any, and the basis for the damage calculations; (d) a signed statement from the party providing the Dispute Notice verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Dispute Notice; and (e) if the dispute is from you, and you have retained an attorney, a signed statement from you authorizing Gemini to disclose your account details to your attorney if necessary in resolving your claim or dispute. Any Dispute Notice from you must be individualized, meaning it can only concern your dispute and no other person’s dispute. And any Dispute Notice from Gemini must be individualized, meaning it can only concern you and no other person. You also agree that, after sending a Demand Notice to Gemini, at Gemini’s request you will personally participate in a discussion by telephone with Gemini to discuss whether an agreement can be reached to resolve the claim before arbitration is initiated. If you are represented by counsel, you agree that you will personally attend the telephone conference with your counsel. Gemini also agrees to participate in such a telephone discussion at your request. Any informal dispute resolution conferences shall be individualized, such that a separate conference must be held each time either party intends to commence individual arbitration; multiple individuals initiating claims cannot participate in the same informal telephonic dispute resolution conference, unless mutually agreed to by the parties. You agree that compliance with these informal dispute resolution procedures is a condition precedent to commencing arbitration, and that the arbitrator shall dismiss any arbitration filed without fully and completely complying with these informal dispute resolution procedures.

The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in these informal dispute resolution procedures.

    <span>Digital Asset trading involves a high degree of risk. The Digital Asset market is new and unproven and may not grow. Digital Assets may experience frequent price volatility due to (i) the small use of Digital Assets in the retail and commercial marketplace in comparison to relatively large use by speculators and (ii) the lack of assurance that a person or institution who accepts Digital Assets as payment today will continue to do so in the future. Such price volatility may adversely affect an investment in Digital Assets so prior to using Gemini, please evaluate the merits and risks of the investment and be able to bear the economic risk of losing your entire investment in a short period of time. No material on Gemini should be considered as an offer by Gemini to sell or solicitation by Gemini of any offer to buy Digital Assets.

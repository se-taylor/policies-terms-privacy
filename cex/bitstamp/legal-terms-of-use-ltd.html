    <strong>How We Verify Your Account
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>The creation and use of your Account are subject to verifications, as required by statutory and regulatory obligations incumbent on us. You agree to provide us with the information we request for the purposes of identity verification, compliance with know-your-customer rules, as well as detection of money laundering, terrorism financing, fraud or any other financial crime. The requested information may include Personal Data (please refer to our&nbsp;
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link--colored text--normal" href="https://www.bitstamp.net/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy
    </a>). By providing us with the information we request, you confirm that it is true and accurate, and agree to inform us in case of change concerning such information. Your Account will be blocked until we are satisfied with the information you have provided and determine in our sole discretion that it is sufficient to validate your Account. In the meantime, you will not be allowed to terminate your Account or request the deletion of the Personal Data processed in the course of verification operations.
  </p>
  <p>We expressly reserve the right to cancel and/or terminate Accounts that have not been verified by the Member despite efforts made in good faith by us to contact you to obtain such verification (“Unverified Accounts”). All Unverified Accounts which have been inactive for a period of 6 months or more are further subject to transfer to a third-party escrow (the “Unverified Escrow”), and will no longer be maintained or under our legal responsibility. The administrator/trustee of the Unverified Escrow shall make any and all additional reasonable efforts required by law to determine and contact each Unverified Account owner and, after suitable effort and time has been expended, we may be required to convert the residual Virtual Assets or other Digital Assets into fiat and send it to a national authority responsible for the safekeeping of such funds
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--secondary">
    <strong>Funding Your Account
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>You may fund your Account via wire deposit or Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) deposits.
  </p>
  <h4 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--tertiary">
    <strong>Wire
    </strong>
  </h4>
  <p>If you have chosen to fund your Account via wire deposits, funds from a wire deposit will be made available for trading on your Account as soon as they are settled. Please note that the deposit settlement times are subject to bank holidays, the processes of partner banks and the processes of your bank. In addition to that, deposit settlement times may be delayed because of any technical issues.
  </p>
  <p>We do not accept fiat currency deposits from third-party bank accounts. The name on your linked bank account must match the name verified on your Bitstamp Account. If a wire transfer is received from a third-party bank account, we will reject and return the wire immediately.
  </p>
  <p>Your Account, once funded, does not and will not earn interest.
  </p>
  <h4 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--tertiary">
    <strong>ACH Payment Method
    </strong>
  </h4>
  <p>If you have enabled ACH funding for your Account, ACH deposit amount will be available for trading on your Account upon receipt of your deposit. We will withhold any funds deposited or any Virtual Assets or Digital Assets bought with them from withdrawal until they are deemed settled. After any such funds are deemed settled, you will be able to make withdrawals again.
  </p>
  <p>Please note that the deposit settlement times are subject to bank holidays, the processes of partner banks and the processes of your bank. In addition to that, deposit settlement times may be delayed because of any technical issues.
  </p>
  <p>We reserve the right to increase or decrease your daily, monthly and overall limits, or make them temporarily or permanently unavailable. This may be done without notice and at our sole discretion.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--secondary">
    <strong>Placing an Electronic Purchase
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>If you are an individual, you can perform an instant Purchase Transaction using your credit or debit card (“Card Purchase”), Google Pay, Apple Pay, or other valid form of payment available on the platform (each a “Valid Payment Method”). The availability of Apple Pay or Google Pay (applicable to credit or debit cards issued by Visa or Mastercard only) depends on your device and your place or residence. For more information on the availability of Apple Pay see 
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/">https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/
    </a>, or 
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://pay.google.com/">https://pay.google.com/
    </a> for Google Pay. The Fees we charge to process instant Purchase Transactions are detailed in our 
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link--colored text--normal" href="https://www.bitstamp.net/fee-schedule/">Fee Schedule
    </a>.
  </p>
  <p>When making a Card Purchase on our website or mobile app, your card data is automatically stored by our card payment service provider via a tokenization process. This means that a sensitive data element (PAN-card number) is substituted with a non-sensitive equivalent called a token. This tokenization process is designed to keep your data safe and secure from unauthorised access by a third party. You can only register a credit or debit card held in your name.
  </p>
  <p>Our appointed payment services provider may save and store payment information, such as credit card or debit card numbers and card expiration dates, entered by you on our website when you make a Card Purchase. Such stored payment information may be used as your default payment method for further Card Purchases on our website or mobile app. At any time, you can delete your card information or enter new card information. If your card has expired, the payment information relating to that particular card will not be stored anymore by our payment service provider and you will be prompted to indicate your new card information the next time you want to proceed with a Card Purchase. You are responsible for maintaining your card information up-to-date and accurate. You consent to Bitstamp updating such stored information from time to time based on information provided by you, your bank or other payments services providers. You will only provide information about payment methods that you are authorized to use.
  </p>
  <p>If you have any questions on how to make a Card Purchase, see our&nbsp;

  <h3 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--secondary">
    <strong>Refund Policy
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>All sales and purchases of Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets done with any payment method are final. We do not accept any returns or provide refunds for your purchase of Virtual Assets or any other Digital Assets from Bitstamp, except for the cases provided in these Terms of Use.
  </p>
  <p>In the event the exchange of fiat currency to Virtual Assets or other Digital Assets is not processed because of any technical issues or high price volatility during the card purchase procedure, Bitstamp will credit the Member’s account with fiat currency.

  <p>Upon Account closure, any amount less than 25 USD/EUR in value will not be returned.
  </p>
  <p>We reserve the right to not convert Virtual Assets or other Digital Assets into fiat and to return them to a Wallet that belongs to the Member.
  </p>
  <p>We similarly reserve the right to freeze Ripple accounts in accordance with the Ripple Labs policy, which took effect on 15 September 2014. Please see the explanation provided by Ripple Labs below:
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The freeze protocol extension gives gateways the ability to 1) globally freeze all their issued funds or 2) freeze funds issued to a specific user. Frozen funds may only be sent back to the issuing gateway. The global freeze feature allows a gateway to freeze all balances it issues. The gateway may still issue payments. Accounts holding frozen balances may return the funds to the gateway. This feature is useful for migrating users from one account to another and to safeguard users in the event that the gateway account is compromised. The individual freeze is primarily intended for compliance with regulatory requirements, which may vary from one jurisdiction to another. It also allows gateways to freeze individual accounts issuances in order to investigate suspicious activity. These features allow gateways to better operate in compliance with laws and regulations.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>For the avoidance of doubt, any action taken by Bitstamp to suspend, delay, cancel or freeze any instructions and/or to suspend your Account will not affect your rights, title or interest in respect of your Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets which are held by a third-party custodian(s) on your behalf, but may affect Bitstamp’s ability to execute your Instructions, which you hereby acknowledge and agree.

    <strong>Risks
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>The trading of goods and products, real or virtual, as well as virtual currencies involves significant risk. The value of cryptocurrencies is highly volatile. It can go down as well as up, and you may not get back the amount you invested. &nbsp;Any currency – virtual or not – may be subject to large swings in value and may even become worthless. Capital Gains Tax could be payable on cryptocurrency profits. For more information on risks inherit to cryptocurrencies please visit: 
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.bitstamp.net/risk-warning/">https://www.bitstamp.net/risk-warning/
    </a>.
  </p>
  <p>Virtual Asset and Digital Asset trading also has special risks not generally shared with official currencies, goods or commodities in a market. Unlike most currencies, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities such as gold or silver, Virtual Assets and Digital Assets are a unique type of asset, backed by technology and trust. There is no central bank that can issue more cryptocurrency or take corrective measures to protect the value of Virtual Assets and Digital Assets in a crisis.
  </p>
  <p>Instead, Virtual Assets and Digital Assets are an as-yet autonomous and largely unregulated global system of cryptocurrency firms and individuals. Traders put their trust in a digital, decentralised and partially anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity.
  </p>
  <p>The trading of Virtual Assets and Digital Assets is often susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could collapse demand relative to supply. For example, confidence in Virtual Assets and Digital Assets might collapse because of unexpected changes imposed by software developers or others, a government crackdown, the creation of superior competing alternative currencies, or a deflationary or inflationary spiral. Confidence might also collapse because of technical problems: if the anonymity of the system is compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments are able to prevent any transactions from settling. There may be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in our Terms of Use.
  </p>
  <p>You should carefully assess whether your financial situation and tolerance for risk is suitable for buying, selling or trading Virtual Assets or Digital Assets.
  </p>
  <p>We use our banking providers in order to facilitate the receipt of fiat currency from Members and payments to other Members. Our banking providers DO NOT transfer, exchange or provide any services in connection with Virtual Assets or Digital Assets. Your fiat currency will be held in a bank account in the name of Bitstamp together with other Members' fiat currency. Where possible in a relevant jurisdiction which recognises the concept of a client account, we will notify the relevant banking provider that the bank account is a client account in which we hold fiat currency on behalf of Members. You will, in any event, remain the beneficial owner of the fiat currency that we hold on your behalf. We will maintain detailed records of all fiat currency held on behalf of Members. Whilst Bitstamp uses reasonable care in the appointment of its banking providers, in the event of a banking provider becoming insolvent or entering into an insolvency process in a relevant jurisdiction, Bitstamp may have only an unsecured claim against the banking provider, and Members’ fiat currency balances may be at risk subject to any protections provided at law in the relevant jurisdiction.
  </p>
  <p>We engage with third-party custodians in order to hold Virtual Assets and Digital Assets on your behalf. Your Virtual Assets and Digital Assets will be held on your behalf in a wallet in the name of Bitstamp together with other Members’ Virtual Assets and/or Digital Assets. They may also from time to time be held in the wallet together with Bitstamp’s Virtual Assets and/or Digital Assets which reflect Bitstamp’s fees, but which are recorded on Bitstamp’s ledger as belonging to Bitstamp, and which you instruct Bitstamp to collect by withdrawing them from the wallet. We will maintain detailed records of all Virtual Assets and Digital Assets which Members hold with third-party custodians appointed by us.
  </p>
  <p>As set out above, Bitstamp will act only on your Instructions in respect of Virtual Assets and Digital Assets, and does not otherwise acquire any right, title or interest in them. Whilst Bitstamp uses reasonable care in the appointment of third-party custodians, in the event of a third-party custodian becoming insolvent or entering into an insolvency process in a relevant jurisdiction, you may have only an unsecured claim against the third-party custodian, and Members' Virtual Assets or Digital Assets may be at risk subject to any protections provided at law in the relevant jurisdiction.

    <strong>Our Approach to Forks or Airdrops in Virtual Assets
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>Bitstamp has no control over the software protocols which govern or constitute the framework of Virtual Assets or other Digital Assets. Therefore, Bitstamp assumes no responsibility for the update or any modification of the underlying protocols, and Bitstamp is not able to guarantee their functionality, security or availability.
  </p>
  <p>By accepting the present Terms of Use, you acknowledge and accept the risk that underlying software protocols relating to any of the virtual currencies available on the Site are likely to be subject to sudden changes in operating rules (hereafter “fork”) or distribution of Virtual Asset (“airdrops”), and such forks or airdrops may materially affect the value, function and/or the name of the virtual currencies that are exchanged or acquired through the Site.
  </p>
  <p>Bitstamp will use reasonable endeavours to provide you with notice of forks or airdrops by publishing such a notice on the Site, including, to the extent possible, whether Bitstamp intends to support airdrops, either or both branches of a fork, and you agree that you will read such notices in order to make a decision in that respect. However, we have no obligation to support any specific forks, airdrops or similar distribution events.
  </p>
  <p>It is your responsibility to make yourself aware of, and consider how to deal with, upcoming forks or airdrops, including whether to give us Instructions for the withdrawal of the balance of any Virtual Assets or other Digital Assets. In the event of a fork or airdrop, there is a risk that Bitstamp may need to temporarily suspend operations in relation to that fork or airdrops without providing advance notice to you. Bitstamp may in its reasonable discretion, decline to support either or both branches of a fork or airdrop.
  </p>
  <p>You acknowledge that third-party custodian-service providers may operate fork or airdrop policies and, under their terms as entered into with you in respect of custodian services, may not be obliged (or able) to support all or any forks or airdrops. You should ensure you check their fork or airdrop policies regularly (as well as the terms of your agreement with custodian-service providers instructed by Bitstamp on your behalf, and available 
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link--colored text--normal" href="https://www.bitstamp.net/bitgo_customer_terms/">here
    </a> and 
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link--colored text--normal" href="https://www.bitstamp.net/copper-customer-terms/">here
    </a>) and whenever you become aware of a forthcoming fork or airdrop. Notwithstanding that a third-party custodian-service provider may support a particular cryptocurrency, including a fork or airdrop, this will not oblige Bitstamp to support that cryptocurrency, airdrop or fork.
  </p>
  <p>In the event of a fork or an airdrop which affects Virtual Assets or other Digital Assets held pursuant to these Terms of Use, and which is unsupported by Bitstamp:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>We will not acquire any right, title or interest in the unsupported forked or airdropped Virtual Asset and/or other Digital Asset; and
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We may be unable to give effect to any Instructions given in respect of those Virtual Assets or other Digital Assets and Bitstamp will have no liability to you in respect of the unsupported forked or airdropped Virtual Assets or other Digital Assets.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>In the event that we subsequently decide to support the forked or airdropped Virtual Assets or other Digital Assets, Bitstamp will then give effect to your Instructions
  </p>
  <p>By agreeing to the present Terms of Use, you acknowledge the risks presented by forks or airdrops and you accept that we have no responsibility to assist you to move or sell Virtual Assets or other Digital Assets of an unsupported branch of a forked or airdropped protocol.

    <strong>Transaction Recovery
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>You are fully responsible for any mistakes, errors or defects which may arise in the course of any transaction that leads to partial or complete loss of your Digital Assets and/or Virtual Assets. Bitstamp shall not be liable for any damages resulting from any actions previously described. Bitstamp shall in no case be liable for any loss, including, but not limited to, transfers between addresses, transactions, deposits or withdrawals resulting from your improper actions or activities, or erroneous transactions, deposits or withdrawals resulting in your Digital Assets and/or Virtual Assets being lost. Bitstamp shall not compensate you for any losses resulting from such actions or activities.
  </p>
  <p>Bitstamp may provide, in certain circumstances, an investigation and possible recovery of the lost Digital Assets and/or Virtual Assets as a payable service. Therefore, Bitstamp may, upon the request of a Member, utilize its best efforts to attempt to return misdirected Digital Assets and/or Virtual Assets to the Member. Requests for transaction recovery shall be sent to 
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="mailto:support@bitstamp.net">support@bitstamp.net
    </a>. After receiving the transaction recovery request, Bitstamp will make a preliminary assessment for each transaction and reserves the right to refuse the recovery of a particular transaction.
  </p>
  <p>Bitstamp will charge an investigation fee for any such investigation. The fee shall amount to 10% of the value of lost Digital Assets and/or Virtual Assets, but in no case less than 100.00 USD/EUR. The fee will be charged and shall be paid by the Member in Digital Assets or Virtual Assets which are subject to the transaction recovery. Bitstamp may investigate transactions that occurred not more than thirty (30) days prior to the date of the request for the recovery of Digital Assets and/or Virtual Assets. Bitstamp will not attempt to recover transactions with the value below 100.00 USD/EUR. Due to the specifics and case-by-case nature, Bitstamp does not, in any way, guarantee success and shall not be liable if the investigation is ineffective or unsuccessful, nor can Bitstamp provide the exact timing for such investigations, but will strive to provide feedback within a reasonable time.

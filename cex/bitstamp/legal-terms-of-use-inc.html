  </p>
  <h3 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--secondary">
    <strong>5.2 How We Verify Your Account
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>The creation and use of your Account are subject to verifications, as required by statutory and regulatory obligations incumbent on us. You agree to provide us with the information we request for the purposes of identity verification, compliance with know-your-customer rules, as well as detection of money laundering, terrorism financing, fraud or any other financial crime. The requested information may include Personal Data (please refer to our&nbsp;
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link--colored text--normal" href="https://www.bitstamp.net/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy
    </a>). By providing us with the information we request, you confirm that it is true and accurate, and agree to inform us in case of change concerning such information. Your Account will be blocked until we are satisfied with the information you have provided and determine in our sole discretion that it is sufficient to validate your Account. In the meantime, you will not be allowed to terminate your Account or request the deletion of the Personal Data processed in the course of verification operations.
  </p>
  <p>We expressly reserve the right to cancel and/or terminate Accounts that have not been verified by the User despite efforts made in good faith by Bitstamp to contact you to obtain such verification (“Unverified Accounts”). We reserve the right to transfer all Unverified Accounts, which have been inactive for a period of 6 months or more, to a third-party escrow (the “Unverified Escrow”). Once transferred, the account assets will no longer be maintained or under the legal responsibility of Bitstamp. The administrator/trustee of the Unverified Escrow shall make any and all additional reasonable efforts required by law to determine and contact each Unverified Account owner and, after suitable effort and time has been expended, we may be required to convert the residual Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets into fiat and send it to a government authority responsible for the safekeeping of such assets. For more information about this process, please see Section 15.4 (Unclaimed Property).
  </p>
  <p>You hereby authorize Bitstamp, directly or through a third party, to make any inquiries Bitstamp considers necessary to verify your identity and/or protect against fraud, including but not limited to: (a)&nbsp;query identity information contained in public reports (e.g., your name, address, past addresses, or date of birth); (b) query account information associated with your linked bank account (e.g., name or account balance); and (c) take action Bitstamp reasonably deems necessary based on the results of such inquiries and reports. You further authorize any and all third parties to which such inquiries or requests may be directed to fully respond to such inquiries or requests. Bitstamp will have no liability or responsibility for any permanent or temporary inability to access or use any Services, including your inability to withdraw Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets or execute “Trades”, as a result of any identity verification or other screening procedures.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--secondary">
    <strong>5.3 Number of Bitstamp Accounts
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>Bitstamp may, in its sole discretion, limit the number of Bitstamp Accounts that you may hold, maintain, or acquire.
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-subtitle">6 GENERAL RISK DISCLOSURES; ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK; RELEASE OF BITSTAMP
  </h2>
  <p>The trading of goods and products, real or virtual, as well as virtual currencies involves significant risk&nbsp;
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link--colored text--normal" href="https://www.bitstamp.net/risk-warning/">(click here for more information)
    </a>. Prices can and do fluctuate on any given day. Such price fluctuations may increase or decrease the value of your assets at any given moment. Any currency – virtual or not – may be subject to large swings in value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading anything on a market.
  </p>
  <p>Virtual Currency and other Digital Asset trading also has special risks not generally shared with official currencies, goods or commodities in a market. Unlike most currencies, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities such as gold or silver, Virtual Assets are a unique type of asset, backed by technology and trust. There is no central bank that can issue more currency or take corrective measures to protect the value of Virtual Assets in a crisis and accounts and value balances are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections. Any bond or trust account maintained by Bitstamp for the benefit of its Users may not be sufficient to cover all losses incurred by Users.
  </p>
  <p>Instead, Virtual Assets are an as-yet autonomous and largely unregulated global system of currency firms and individuals. Traders put their trust in a digital, decentralized and partially anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity. Some virtual currency transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that the User initiates the transaction.
  </p>
  <p>Trading Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets, and use of other Services provided by Bitstamp, also involves significant risks and potential for financial losses, including without limitation the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The features, functions, characteristics, operation, use and other properties of any Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets (“
        <strong>Digital Asset Properties
        </strong>”) and the software, networks, protocols, systems, and other technology (including, if applicable, any blockchain) (“
        <strong>Underlying Technology
        </strong>”) used to administer, create, issue, transfer, cancel, use or transact in any Token may be complex, technical or difficult to understand or evaluate.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Any Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets and its Underlying Technology may be vulnerable to hacking, cyber attack or other attacks on the security, integrity or operation of the Token or its Underlying Technology (“
        <strong>Attacks
        </strong>”), including Attacks using computing power sufficient to overwhelm the normal operation of a blockchain or other Underlying Technology.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Due to the nature of Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets, there is an increased risk of fraud or Attacks and your assets or the value of your assets may be irretrievably stolen.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Any Token, Digital Asset Properties or Underlying Technology may change or otherwise cease to operate as expected due to a change made to the Underlying Technology, a change made using features or functions built into the Underlying Technology or a change resulting from an Attack. These changes may include, without limitation, a “fork” or “rollback” of a Virtual Asset and other Digital Assets or blockchain.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Any Virtual Asset and other Digital Asset may be cancelled, lost or double spent, or otherwise lose all or most of their value, due to forks, rollbacks, Attacks, changes to Digital Asset Properties or failure of the Virtual Asset and other Digital Asset to operate as intended.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The trading of Virtual Assets is often susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could collapse demand relative to supply. For example, confidence in Virtual Assets might collapse because of unexpected changes imposed by software developers or others, a government crackdown, the creation of superior competing alternative currencies, or a deflationary or inflationary spiral. Confidence might also collapse because of technical problems: if the anonymity of the system is compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments are able to prevent any transactions from settling. Additionally, legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange and value of virtual currency.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You should be aware that the value of virtual currency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for virtual currency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular virtual currency should the market for that virtual currency disappear.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Bitstamp may suspend or cease to support the transfer, storage or trading of any Token at any time at Bitstamp’s discretion. Other exchanges and service providers may do the same.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Bitstamp may not support metacoins, colored coins or other Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets, or their related side chains or other Underlying Technology that are based on a fork, airdrop, enhancement, or derivative of a different Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets or Underlying Technology (“
        <strong>Derivative Protocols
        </strong>”) even if the Derivative Protocol is based on a Virtual Asset and other Digital Asset that is supported by Bitstamp. Other exchanges or service providers may do the same.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Bitstamp may suspend or reject your transaction requests, suspend or cease support for Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets, or suspend or terminate your access to the Services to comply with applicable laws or regulations or an order from law enforcement or other governmental authority, for other reasons as specified in these Terms or otherwise at Bitstamp’s discretion.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You may be unable to withdraw Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets prior to Bitstamp ceasing to support transfer of any such Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets, or you may be unable to withdraw Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets or fiat currency prior to Bitstamp terminating any Services or your access to your Bitstamp Account, resulting in the loss of any such Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets or fiat currency remaining in your Bitstamp Account.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Any Virtual Asset and other Digital Asset may decrease in value or lose all of its value due to various factors including discovery of wrongful conduct, market manipulation, changes to Digital Asset Properties or perceived value of Digital Asset Properties, Attacks, suspension or cessation of support for a Token by Bitstamp or other exchanges or service providers, and other factors outside the control of Bitstamp.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Any Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets may decrease in value or lose all of its value due to legislative or regulatory activity, or other government action. Government regulation of Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets is unsettled and rapidly evolving.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Any Virtual Asset or other Digital Asset may be lost if sent to the wrong address (for example but without limitation, if the address is improperly formatted, contains errors, or is intended to be used for a different type of Token). If you send Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets to an address intended for a different type of Virtual Asset and other Digital Asset, your assets may be lost. Bitstamp may try, but is not obligated to, conduct recovery efforts to recover assets that were sent to the wrong address. For more information, please see below Section 13.6 (Transaction Recovery).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You may be prevented from sending a transaction request, or your transaction request or email may not be received by Bitstamp or the Services, due to hardware, software or services issues (including, without limitation, Internet and other network connectivity issues).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Your transaction request or email to Bitstamp or the Services may be lost, intercepted or altered during transmission.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Unauthorized third parties may access or use your Bitstamp Account and effect transactions without your knowledge or authorization, whether by obtaining the password to your Bitstamp Account, obtaining control over another device or account used by you in connection with any enhanced security measures enabled for your account, or by other methods.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>There may be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in our Terms of Use.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The risks described in this Section 6 may result in loss of your Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets, decrease in or loss of all value for your Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets, inability to access or transfer Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets, inability to trade Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets, inability to receive financial benefits available to other Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets holders, and other financial losses to you. You hereby assume, and agree that Bitstamp will have no responsibility or liability for, such risks. You hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge any and all claims, whether known or unknown to you, against Bitstamp, its Affiliates and their respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives related to any of the risks set forth herein. You waive application of Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California, or any similar statute or law of any other jurisdiction. Section 1542 reads as follows: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”
  </p>
  <p>You represent and warrant that you have: (a) the necessary technical expertise and ability to review and evaluate the security, integrity and operation of any Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets that you decide to acquire or trade; and (b) the knowledge, experience, understanding, professional advice and information to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets or Trade. You accept the risk of trading Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets by using the Services and are responsible for conducting your own independent analysis of the risks specific to the Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets and the Services. You should not acquire or trade any Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets unless you have sufficient financial resources and can afford to lose all value of the Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets.
  </p>
  <p>Bitstamp’s decision to support transfer, storage or trading of any particular Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets through the Services does not indicate Bitstamp’s approval or disapproval of the Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets or the integrity, security or operation of the Virtual Asset and other Digital Asset or its Underlying Technology. The risks associated with Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets and trading such assets apply notwithstanding Bitstamp’s decision to support a particular asset. Bitstamp does not provide trading advice, does not have any fiduciary duty to you or any other user and does not make any warranty about the suitability of any asset for trading or ownership by you.

  <p>You may fund your Account via wire deposit or Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) deposits.
  </p>
  <h4 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--tertiary">8.1.1 Wire
  </h4>
  <p>If you have chosen to fund your Account via wire deposits, funds from a wire deposit will be made available for trading on your Account as soon as they are settled. Please note that the deposit settlement times are subject to bank holidays, the processes of partner banks and the processes of your bank. In addition to that, deposit settlement times may be delayed because of any technical issues. Please note, for deposit and withdrawals, although you generally will receive your payment within a week, settlement may take up to two weeks, depending on your financial institution.
  </p>
  <p>We do not accept fiat currency deposits from third-party bank accounts. The name on your linked bank account must match the name verified on your Bitstamp Account. If a wire transfer is received from a third-party bank account, we will reject and return the wire immediately.
  </p>
  <p>Your Account, once funded, does not and will not earn interest.

  <h4 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--tertiary">8.1.2 ACH Payment Method
  </h4>
  <p>If you have enabled ACH funding for your Account, ACH deposit amount will be available for trading on your Account upon receipt of your deposit. You will not be able to withdraw fiat or crypto balances showing in your Bitstamp Account until the ACH deposit has settled. After any such funds are deemed settled, you will be able to make withdrawals again.
  </p>
  <p>Please note that the deposit settlement times are subject to bank holidays, the processes of partner banks and the processes of your bank. In addition to that, deposit settlement times may be delayed because of any technical issues. For ACH deposit and withdrawals, we have a standard seven-day (7) hold on the funds awaiting settlement. Final settlement may longer, depending on your financial institution.

  <p>If you are an individual, you can perform an instant Purchase Transaction using your credit or debit card, (“Card Purchase”), Google Pay, Apple Pay, or other valid form of payment (each a “Valid Payment Method”). The Fees we charge to process instant Purchase Transactions are detailed in our 
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link--colored text--normal" href="https://www.bitstamp.net/fee-schedule/">Fee Schedule

After that period, this restriction will be lifted and withdrawals will be re-enabled.
  </p>
  <p>When making a Card Purchase on our website or mobile app, your card data is automatically stored by our card payment service provider via a tokenization process. This means that a sensitive data element (PAN-card number) is substituted with a non-sensitive equivalent called a token. This tokenization process is designed to keep your data safe and secure from unauthorized access by a third party. You can only register a credit or debit card held in your name.
  </p>
  <p>Our appointed payment services provider may save and store payment information, such as credit card or debit card numbers and card expiration dates, entered by you on our website when you make a Card Purchase or use another Valid Payment Method. Such stored payment information may be used as your default payment method for further Card Purchases on our website or mobile app. At any time, you can delete your card information or enter new card information. If your card has expired, the payment information relating to that particular card will not be stored anymore by our payment service provider and you will be prompted to indicate your new card information the next time you want to proceed with a Card Purchase. You are responsible for maintaining your card information up-to-date and accurate. You consent to Bitstamp updating such stored information from time to time based on information provided by you, your bank or other payments services providers. You will only provide information about payment methods that you are authorized to use.

    <strong>12.1 Changes to Services

  </h3>
  <p>Bitstamp may, at its discretion and without liability to you, with or without prior notice and at any time, modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, all or any portion of any Services.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--secondary">
    <strong>12.2 Suspension or Termination of Services
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>Bitstamp may, at its discretion and without liability to you, with notice where possible or practicable and at any time, temporarily suspend or permanently terminate your access to all or a portion of any Services.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--secondary">
    <strong>12.3 No Liability
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>Bitstamp will not be liable for any losses suffered by you resulting from any modification of any Services or from any suspension or termination of your access to all or a portion of any Services (whether pursuant to this Section 12 or for any other reason). You acknowledge that Virtual Currency and other Digital Asset valuations and exchange rates may fluctuate during any period during which Services have been suspended and that Bitstamp will have no liability for any such fluctuations. You also acknowledge that in the event of permanent suspension or termination of Services the Virtual Currency and other Digital Asset and fiat currency associated with your Bitstamp Account may be lost due to your inability to access, transfer or otherwise control the Virtual Currency and other Digital Asset and fiat currency and that Bitstamp will have no liability for any such losses.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--secondary">
    <strong>12.4 Effect of Termination
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>The suspension or escrow of an Account shall not affect the payment of Fees due for past Transactions.
  </p>
  <p>Upon termination or suspension, you shall send details of a valid bank account to allow for the transfer of any currencies credited to their account. This bank account must be held by you. Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets value may be transferred to a valid bank account only after conversion into a fiat currency. We shall transfer the currencies as soon as possible following your request and within the time frames specified above.
  </p>
  <p>We will arrange to send you the credit balance of your Account; however, in certain circumstances a number of intermediaries may be involved in an international payment and these or the beneficiary bank may deduct charges. We will make all reasonable efforts to ensure that such charges are disclosed to you prior to sending your payment; however, where they cannot be avoided, you acknowledge that these charges cannot always be calculated in advance, and that you agree to be responsible for such charges.
  </p>
  <p>We reserve the right to not convert Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets into fiat and to return them to a Wallet that belongs to the User.
  </p>
  <p>We similarly reserve the right to freeze Ripple IOU account access, according to Ripple Labs’ policy. Please see the explanation provided by Ripple Labs below:
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The freeze protocol extension gives gateways the ability to 1) globally freeze all their issued funds or 2)&nbsp;freeze funds issued to a specific user. Frozen funds may only be sent back to the issuing gateway. The global freeze feature allows a gateway to freeze all balances it issues. The gateway may still issue payments. Accounts holding frozen balances may return the funds to the gateway. This feature is useful for migrating users from one account to another and to safeguard users in the event that the gateway account is compromised. The individual freeze is primarily intended for compliance with regulatory requirements, which may vary from one jurisdiction to another. It also allows gateways to freeze individual accounts issuances in order to investigate suspicious activity. These features allow gateways to better operate in compliance with laws and regulations.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>For the avoidance of doubt, any action taken by Bitstamp to suspend, delay, cancel or freeze any instructions and/or to suspend your Account will not affect your rights, title or interest in respect of your Virtual Assets and other Digital Assets which are held by a third-party custodian on your behalf, but may affect Bitstamp’s ability to execute your Instructions, which you hereby acknowledge and agree.

  <h2 class="text-subtitle">13 TRADING WITH BITSTAMP
  </h2>
  <h3 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--secondary">
    <strong>13.1 Orders; Fees
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>Bitstamp maintains a transparent order book that allows Users to view all open buy and sell offers Bitstamp will facilitate three types of orders: instant, limit and stop orders. In the case of an instant order, Bitstamp will fulfill the instant order by matching it with the best-priced limit order(s). Limit orders remain open until filled or withdrawn by the User. An “Order” is created when you enter an instruction to effect a Trade using the Services. When you enter an Order you authorize Bitstamp to execute a Trade on a spot basis for all or a portion of the number of Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets or the amount of fiat currency specified in your Order in accordance with such Order. You agree to pay Bitstamp any applicable fees for Trades and authorize Bitstamp to deduct any such fees from your Bitstamp wallet. A “Trade” is an exchange of Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets, or an exchange of fiat currency for Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets, in each case for which trading is supported on the Services between you and another user of the Services whereby you dispose of certain Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets or fiat currency and acquire different Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets or fiat currency.

No communication or information provided to you by Bitstamp is intended as, or shall be considered or construed as, advice. Please refer to Sections 6-7 for a summary of some of the risks you should consider when choosing whether to use our Services.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--secondary">
    <strong>13.3 Orders Confirmation
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>Before an Order is placed, the Services will generate and display a confirmation dialogue box summarizing the details of the proposed transaction, including type and amount of Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets you are seeking to dispose of, the type and amount of Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets or fiat currency that you are willing to accept in exchange for the Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets or fiat currency you are seeking to dispose of, Bitstamp’s estimated fees if the entire Order were to be executed, and the total number and type of Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets or the amount of fiat currency, as applicable, that will be transferred out of your Bitstamp wallet if the entire Order were to be executed. Your Order will be placed upon confirmation of the Order summary via the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that the failure of the Services to provide such Order summary or confirmation shall not prejudice or invalidate any Order submitted by you or any Trade completed based on such Order.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--secondary">
    <strong>13.4 Order Matching and Trade Execution
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>Upon placement of an Order, your Bitstamp Account will be updated to reflect the open Order and your Order will be included in Bitstamp’s order book for matching with Orders from other users. If all or a portion of your Order is matched with another user, the Services will execute a Trade. Upon execution of a Trade, your Bitstamp Account will be updated to reflect that the Order has either been closed due to having been fully executed, or updated to reflect any partial fulfillment of the Order. Orders will remain open until fully executed or cancelled in accordance with Section 13.5 below. For purposes of effectuating a Trade, you authorize Bitstamp to take temporary control of the Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets that you are disposing of in the Trade.

  </p>
  <h3 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--secondary">
    <strong>13.7 Cancellations
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>You may only cancel an order initiated via the Services if such cancellation occurs before your Order has been matched with an Order from another user. Once your Order has been matched with an Order from another user, you may not change, withdraw, stop payment, or cancel your authorization for Bitstamp to complete such Order. If any order has been partially matched, you may cancel the unmatched portion of the Order unless and until the unmatched portion has been matched. Bitstamp reserves the right to refuse any cancellation request associated with a market Order after you have submitted such Order.

  <p>Bitstamp may, at any time and in its sole discretion, refuse any transfer request or other transaction request submitted via the Services, impose limits on the amounts of transfers or Trades that can be completed on a daily or other periodic basis or impose any other conditions or restrictions upon your use of the Services, without prior notice. For example, Bitstamp may: (a) limit the number of open Orders that you can establish via the Services; (b) restrict transaction requests from certain locations; or (c) restrict withdrawals or trading if there is a reasonable suspicion of fraud, diminished capacity, inappropriate activity, or if Bitstamp receives reasonable notice that your ownership of some or all of the Tokens in your Bitstamp Account is in dispute.

    <strong>14.2 Accuracy of Information

  <h3 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--secondary">
    <strong>14.3 Support for Particular Assets
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>Bitstamp retains the right, in its sole discretion, to determine whether to support the transfer, storage or trading of any Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets using the Services, and may discontinue or terminate any support for any Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets at any time for any or no reason. Unless otherwise required by law or law enforcement, Bitstamp will make reasonable efforts to notify you of its decision to cease to support of a Virtual Asset or other Digital Asset. If Bitstamp ceases to support transfer or storage of a particular Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets using the Services, Bitstamp will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you at least 30 days prior so as to afford you with an opportunity to transfer the affected Token from your Bitstamp wallet to an External Address. If you do not transfer the affected Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets out of your Bitstamp wallet prior to cessation of support for the Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets by Bitstamp, the Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets may be lost due to your inability to access, transfer or otherwise control the Virtual Asset or other Digital Asset. Bitstamp will not be liable to you for any losses, liability or expenses related to its decision to cease any support for any Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets.

  <h3 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--secondary">
    <strong>14.4 Delisting Particular Digital Assets
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>From time to time, and in our sole discretion, we may remove one or more Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets from the Platform such that you will no longer be able to access such Digital Assets as part of the Trading Services and will no longer be able to maintain balances in such Digital Assets or make any deposits or withdrawal thereof, in each case with immediate effect for any reason or no reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, where we are required to do so by any applicable law or regulation (including, without limitation, any U.S. federal or state securities laws), or any court or authority to which we are subject in any jurisdictions. You hereby acknowledge and consent to our ability to take such delisting actions, including, without limitations, to cancel your outstanding Instructions for delisted Digital Assets and require you to remove delisted Digital Assets within a reasonable period of time, beyond which you will no longer be able to access the delisted Virtual Currency or Other Digital Asset.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--secondary">
    <strong>14.5 Our Approach to Forks and Airdrops in Virtual Assets
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>Bitstamp has no control over the software protocols which govern or constitute the framework of virtual currencies. Therefore, Bitstamp assumes no responsibility for the update or any modification of the underlying protocols, and Bitstamp is not able to guarantee their functionality, security or availability.
  </p>
  <p>By accepting the present Terms of Use, you acknowledge and accept the risk that underlying software protocols relating to any of the virtual currencies available on the platform are likely to be subject to sudden changes in operating rules (hereafter “fork”) or distribution of Virtual Asset (“airdrops”), and such forks or airdrops may materially affect the value, function and/or the name of the virtual currencies that are exchanged or acquired on the platform.
  </p>
  <p>Where possible, Bitstamp may provide you with notices or alerts on forks or airdrops, including, to the extent possible, whether Bitstamp intends to support airdrops, either or both branches of a fork, and you agree that you will read such notices in order to make a decision in that respect. However, we have no obligation to support any specific forks, airdrops or similar distribution events.
  </p>
  <p>It is your responsibility to make yourself aware of, and consider how to deal with, upcoming forks or airdrops, including whether to give us Instructions for the withdrawal of the balance of any Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets. In the event of a fork or an airdrop, there is a risk that Bitstamp may need to temporarily suspend operations in relation to that fork or airdrop without providing advance notice to you. Bitstamp may, in its reasonable discretion, decline to support either or both branches of a fork or an airdrop.
  </p>
  <p>You acknowledge that third-party custodian service providers may operate fork or airdrop policies and, under their terms as entered into with you in respect of custodian services, may not be obliged (or able) to support all or any forks or airdrops. You should ensure you check their fork or airdrop policies regularly (as well as the terms of your agreement with custodian-service providers instructed by Bitstamp on your behalf, and available&nbsp;
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link--colored text--normal" href="https://www.bitstamp.net/bitgo_customer_terms/">here
    </a> and 
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link--colored text--normal" href="https://www.bitstamp.net/copper-customer-terms/">here
    </a>) and whenever you become aware of a forthcoming fork or airdrop. Notwithstanding that a third-party custodian-service provider may support a particular cryptocurrency, including a fork or an airdrop, this will not oblige Bitstamp to support that cryptocurrency, airdrop or fork.
  </p>
  <p>In the event of a fork or an airdrop which affects Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets pursuant to these Terms of Use, and which is unsupported by Bitstamp:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>We will not acquire any right, title or interest in the unsupported forked or airdropped Virtual Asset and/or other Digital Assets; and
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We may be unable to give effect to any Instructions given in respect of those Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets and Bitstamp will have no liability to you in respect of the unsupported forked or airdropped Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>In the event that we subsequently decide to support the forked or airdropped Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets, Bitstamp will then give effect to your Instructions.
  </p>
  <p>By agreeing to the present Terms of Use, you acknowledge the risks presented by forks or airdrops and you accept that Bitstamp has no responsibility to assist you to move or sell Virtual Currency or other Digital Assets of an unsupported branch of a forked or airdropped protocol.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--secondary">
    <strong>14.6 Transaction Recovery
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>You are fully responsible for any mistakes, errors or defects which may arise in the course of any transaction that leads to partial or complete loss of your Virtual Currency or other Digital Assets. Bitstamp shall not be liable for any damages resulting from any actions previously described. Bitstamp shall in no case be liable for any loss, including, but not limited to, transfers between addresses, transactions, deposits or withdrawals resulting from your improper actions or activities, or erroneous transactions, deposits or withdrawals resulting in your Virtual Currency or other Digital Assets being lost. Bitstamp shall not compensate you for any losses resulting from such actions or activities.
  </p>
  <p>Bitstamp may provide, in certain circumstances, an investigation and possible recovery of the lost Virtual Currency or other Digital Assets as a payable service. Therefore, Bitstamp may, upon the request of a User, utilize its best efforts to attempt to return misdirected Virtual Currency or other Digital Assets to the User. Requests for transaction recovery shall be sent to 
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="mailto:support@bitstamp.net">support@bitstamp.net
    </a>. After receiving the transaction recovery request, Bitstamp will make a preliminary assessment for each transaction and reserves the right to refuse the recovery of a particular transaction.
  </p>
  <p>Bitstamp may charge an investigation fee for any such investigation. The fee shall amount to 10% of the value of lost Virtual Currency or other Digital Assets, but in no case less than 100.00 USD. The fee will be charged and shall be paid by the User in Virtual Currency or other Digital Assets which are subject to the transaction recovery. Bitstamp may investigate transactions that occurred not more than thirty (30) days prior to the date of the request for the recovery of Virtual Currency or other Digital Assets. Bitstamp will not attempt to recover transactions with the value below $100.00 (USD). Due to the specifics and case-by-case nature, Bitstamp does not, in any way, guarantee success and shall not be liable if the investigation is ineffective or unsuccessful, nor can Bitstamp provide the exact timing for such investigations, but will strive to provide feedback within a reasonable time.
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-subtitle">15 Compliance with Law
  </h2>
  <p>You are responsible for complying with all applicable laws related to your trading activities and other use of the Services, including without limitation any reporting obligations and payment of all applicable taxes.

  </h3>
  <p>In certain circumstances, Bitstamp may have an obligation to report any Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets in your wallet or any fiat currency in your Bitstamp Account to the applicable governmental entity as unclaimed property, such as where your Bitstamp Account has been inactive for a period of several years (as defined by the relevant state statutes) or where Bitstamp ceases providing Services. If this happens, Bitstamp will attempt to contact you using the contact information provided by you. If you do not respond, Bitstamp may be obligated to turn over any Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets in your wallet or any fiat currency in your Bitstamp Account to the applicable governmental entity after deducting any fees payable to Bitstamp. The applicable governmental entity may require Bitstamp to liquidate any Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets in your Bitstamp Account into fiat currency and turn over the resulting fiat currency to the governmental entity. You agree that Bitstamp will not have any responsibility or liability for any losses, damages, or other harm that you may incur in connection with Bitstamp turning over Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets or fiat currency to the applicable governmental entity or Bitstamp’s liquidation of the Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets.

  <h3 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--secondary">
    <strong>15.4 Property Disputes

  <p>If Bitstamp receives notice that any Virtual Currency or other Digital Assets held in your Bitstamp wallet are alleged to have been stolen or otherwise are not lawfully possessed by you, Bitstamp may, but has no obligation to, place an administrative hold on the affected Virtual Currency or other Digital Assets or your Bitstamp wallet. If Bitstamp does place an administrative hold on some or all of your Virtual Currency or other Digital Assets, Bitstamp may continue such hold until such time as the dispute has been resolved and evidence of the resolution acceptable to Bitstamp has been provided to Bitstamp in a form acceptable to Bitstamp. Bitstamp will not involve itself in any such dispute or the resolution of the dispute. You agree that Bitstamp will have no liability or responsibility for any such hold, or for your inability to withdraw Virtual Currency or other Digital Assets or execute Trades during the period of any such hold.

    <strong>15.5 Death of Account Holder
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>For security reasons, if we receive legal documentation confirming your death or other information leading us to believe you have died, we will block certain activities from occurring on your Bitstamp Account. During this time, no transactions may be completed until: (i) your designated fiduciary has opened a new Bitstamp Account or provides access to the designated fiduciary’s currently opened Bitstamp Account, as further described below, and the entirety of your Bitstamp Account has been transferred to such new account, (ii) your designated fiduciary sends Bitstamp bank account information, where Bitstamp converts any Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets in the account into fiat currency and the value is sent to the requestor’s bank account, or (iii) we have received proof in a form satisfactory to us that you have not died. If we have reason to believe you may have died but we do not have proof of your death in a form satisfactory to us, you authorize us to make inquiries, whether directly or through third parties, that we consider necessary to ascertain whether you have died. Upon receipt by us of proof satisfactory to us that you have died, the fiduciary you have designated in a valid Will or similar testamentary document will be required to open a new Bitstamp Account and complete all required verification procedures, unless they already have a verified Bitstamp Account opened in their name. If you have not designated a fiduciary, then we reserve the right to (i) treat as your fiduciary any person entitled to inherit your Bitstamp Account, as determined by us upon receipt and review of the documentation we, in our sole and absolute discretion, deem necessary or appropriate, or (ii) require an order designating a fiduciary from a court having competent jurisdiction over your estate. Documents required to begin this process must be in the English language, or translated to the English language prior to acceptance. Documents collected include: Death Certificate (color scan or photo of the original document), an official document identifying the requestor as an administrator of the deceased User’s estate or heir to the estate, a selfie and photo of a valid identification document of the requestor. Generally, a Will of the deceased person is not sufficient to satisfy these requirements. In the event we determine, in our sole and absolute discretion, that there is uncertainty regarding the validity of the fiduciary designation, we reserve the right to require an order resolving such issue from a court of competent jurisdiction before taking any action relating to your Bitstamp Account. Pursuant to the above, unless your fiduciary already has a Bitstamp Account, the opening of a new Bitstamp Account by a designated fiduciary is mandatory following the death of a Bitstamp Account owner if the fiduciary decides to keep the assets as Virtual Currency or Other Digital Assets. You hereby agree that your fiduciary will be required to hold a Bitstamp Account and provide the information required under Section&nbsp;5 of this Agreement in order to gain access to the assets contained in your Bitstamp Account. No fiduciary Bitstamp Account is required if the designated fiduciary converts the assets to fiat currency and has the value sent to an approved bank account. Further, no fiduciary Bitstamp Account is required if the deceased’s account does not hold any value.

  <h2 class="text-subtitle">25 Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration
  </h2>
  <p>Most User concerns can be resolved by contacting Bitstamp’s customer service department. In the event Customer service is unable to resolve a complaint to your satisfaction, this section explains how claims can be resolved through arbitration.
  </p>
  <p>Please read the following section carefully because it requires you and us to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with each other and limits the manner in which we can seek relief from each other, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration agreement. In addition, arbitration precludes you or us from suing in court or having a jury trial.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--secondary">
    <strong>25.1 No Representative Actions
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>You and Bitstamp agree that any dispute arising out of, or related to, these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Bitstamp and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--secondary">
    <strong>25.2 Arbitration of Disputes
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>Except for small claims disputes in which you or Bitstamp seek to bring an individual action in a small claims court located in the county of your billing address or enter disputes in which you or Bitstamp seek injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and Bitstamp waive our respective rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of, or related to, these Terms or our Services resolved in court. Instead, for any dispute or claim that you have against Bitstamp, or relating in any way to the Services, you agree to first contact Bitstamp and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“Notice”) to Bitstamp by email at&nbsp;
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="mailto:support@bitstamp.net">support@bitstamp.net
    </a>&nbsp;or by certified mail addressed to Bitstamp USA, Inc., 27 Union Square West, New York, NY 10003. The Notice should (a) include your name, residence address, email address and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. In the event Bitstamp has a complaint against you, we will also follow the described above. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and Bitstamp cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. 
    <em>See 
    </em>JAMS Consumer Rules, 
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/">https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/
    </a>. All disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in person in the consumer’s hometown area, in accordance with the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS website at 
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-download">https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-download
    </a> and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understood the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.
  </p>
  <p>Arbitration Fees
  </p>
  <p>You and Bitstamp agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the first $250 of the filing fee and Bitstamp will pay the remaining arbitration fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Bitstamp, Bitstamp will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Bitstamp agree that the state or federal courts of the State of New York and the United States sitting in New York County, New York, have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--secondary">
    <strong>25.3 Mass Arbitration – Batch Arbitration Approach
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Bitstamp agree that in the event that there are one hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Bitstamp by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), JAMS shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one neutral JAMS arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”).
  </p>
  <p>All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise JAMS, and JAMS administrators shall appoint a sole standing neutral arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Bitstamp.
  </p>
  <p>You and Bitstamp agree to cooperate in good faith with JAMS to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.
  </p>
  <p>This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--secondary">
    <strong>25.4 Interstate Commerce
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>You and Bitstamp agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 25 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As specified by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--secondary">
    <strong>25.5 Confidentiality of Arbitration Proceedings
    </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>The arbitrator, Bitstamp and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of virtual currency.

    <li>
      <p>Transactions in virtual currency may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Some virtual currency transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that the User initiates the transaction.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The value of virtual currency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for virtual currency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular virtual currency should the market for that virtual currency disappear.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>There is no assurance that a person who accepts a virtual currency as payment today will continue to do so in the future.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The volatility and unpredictability of the price of virtual currency relative to fiat currency may result in significant loss over a short period of time.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The nature of virtual currency may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attack.

    <strong>1.1 Earn SERVICES ARE OPTIONAL
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>Bitstamp Earn Services may be made available to you by default for Virtual Currencies or Other Digital Currencies where staking functionality is available on Bitstamp. YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN EARN SERVICES WITH BITSTAMP, EVEN IF YOU HOLD ASSETS THAT CAN BE INCLUDED IN THE PROGRAM. ONCE YOU HAVE STAKED ASSETS, IN MANY INSTANCES, THEY MUST REMAIN LOCKED FOR A SET PERIOD OF TIME. IF YOU DECIDE TO STOP STAKING, ONCE YOUR ASSET LOCK PERIOD HAS ENDED, YOU CAN REMOVE YOUR ASSETS FROM THE STAKING SERVICES. FOR MORE DETAILS ABOUT STARTING AND STOPPING EARN SERVICES, PLEASE SEE THE 
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link--colored text--normal" href="https://www.bitstamp.net/bitstamp-earn/">BITSTAMP EARN PAGE
    </a>. Unless otherwise specified, if you opt-out of staking services, you can opt back in at any time with immediate effect.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>1.2 Using Earn services
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>Bitstamp Earn Services offers customers three separate and distinct products, which are described below: (1)&nbsp;Staking, (2) Inflation, and (3) Governance (collectively “Earn Products”). The type of Earn Products applicable to the Virtual Assets or Digital Assets held will depend on the specific asset. All Earn Products produce a reward for contributing in some way to the underlying protocol (collectively “Earn Rewards”). Depending on the Earn Product, Bitstamp may work with a third-party vendor to offer you the Earn Services.
  </p>
  <p>Earn Products are provided on opt-in or opt-out basis, which depends on the individual assets available for Earn Rewards (“Earn Assets”) held in your Bitstamp Account. Some assets exist on protocols which require that a certain amount of Earn Assets be locked for a certain period of time. Descriptions of Earn Products specifics and related specific terms for each Earn Asset are available within the Bitstamp platform and/or on our FAQ page.
  </p>
  <p>You are not required to use Earn Services when you have an account with Bitstamp. You can opt-out of Earn Services for such Earn Assets at any time through the Bitstamp platform. Some protocols that hold Earn Assets may stipulate a certain amount of time that needs to pass after you opt-out from an Earn Product, before your opt-out request becomes effective and your Earn Assets can be removed and usable (“Lockup Period”). If you opt-out of Earn Services, you can opt back in at any time with immediate effect. As soon as you opt-out of the Earn Services for a particular Earn Asset, you stop receiving Earn Rewards for the said Earn Products immediately. Earn Rewards will instead continue to be received and taken by Bitstamp as a fee for enabling opt-out or apportioned as Earn Rewards to other participating users. You acknowledge and agree that these Rewards will not be paid to you, and you have no right to them whatsoever.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>1.3 Opt-In Approach
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>Bitstamp Earn Products include Earn Assets with the opt-in approach. For opt-in Earn Assets, in order to participate in the Earn Product and to collect Earn Rewards, you must opt in by selecting the Earn Assets from your Bitstamp Account you wish to include in the program. By opting in, your Earn Assets may remain in its respective protocol. In some Earn Products, participation of such Earn Assets is terminated only when the Earn Assets are withdrawn from your Bitstamp account. Bitstamp may credit you the applicable percentage of Earn Rewards earned in the time period and attributable to your Earn Assets, as detailed in your Bitstamp Account.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>1.4 Opt-Out Approach
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>Bitstamp Earn Products also include Earn Assets with the opt-out approach. For opt-out Earn Assets, you do not need to do anything in order to participate in the Earn Product and to collect Earn Rewards. Earn Assets in your Bitstamp Account that are opt out are included in the applicable Earn Product by default. If you do not wish to participate in Earn Services for these Earn Assets, you may opt out of the program. Bitstamp may credit to you the applicable percentage of Earn Rewards earned in the time period and attributable to your Earn Assets, as detailed in your Bitstamp Account.
  </p>
  <p>You may choose not to participate. If you decide to opt out, you must opt out by selecting the Earn Assets from your Bitstamp Account you wish to exclude from the program.
  </p>
  <h4 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--tertiary">2 EARN PRODUCTS
  </h4>
  <p>
    <strong>2.1 EARN PRODUCT: STAKING
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>Staking is based on proof of stake (“PoS”), an algorithm used by some blockchains to reach consensus on the one true history of transactions. If you stake your Virtual Assets or Digital Assets on a PoS blockchain, the blockchain’s algorithm may give you the right to generate a new block and reward you with a predetermined amount of Virtual Assets or Digital Assets (“Staking Rewards”). Staking allows you to earn more cryptocurrency by using the cryptocurrency you already own and staking it for a set period of time.
  </p>
  <p>When you hold Virtual Assets or Digital Assets on your Bitstamp Account, you may be given the option to stake these assets in a third-party PoS network via the services provided by Bitstamp (“Staking Products”).
  </p>
  <p>For Virtual Assets or Digital Assets where staking functionality is available (“Stakeable Assets”), Bitstamp will make Staking Products available to you by default. If you elect to stake your available Stakeable Assets through the Bitstamp platform, thus creating customer “Staked Assets,” you agree to appoint Bitstamp as your agent and delegate to stake your Staked Assets with the third-party PoS network. Bitstamp works with a third-party staking provider to operate staking node services. Bitstamp’s customers’ Staked Assets are staked on the appropriate asset’s network by Bitstamp through this third-party staking provider.
  </p>
  <p>You remain the lawful and beneficial owner of “Staked Assets” and the beneficial owner of additional assets resulting from any applicable Staking Reward which is effectively being generated in the staking nodes owned, maintained, and operated at the location of a third-party staking provider. Bitstamp does not own any Staked Assets that it holds for you or stakes on your behalf. You do not transfer ownership of the Staked Assets to Bitstamp or to the third-party staking provider during the staking process.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>2.2 EARN PRODUCT: Inflation
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>Some Blockchain protocols add new tokens to the network at a rate determined by the protocol, and those tokens are then distributed to holders as inflation rewards (“Inflation Rewards”). This process is called Inflation. Bitstamp supports some assets that receive Inflation Rewards (“Inflation Products”). Inflation Products allow you to add more Virtual Assets or Digital Assets to your Bitstamp Account by holding the Earn Assets you already own and receiving rewards via Inflation Rewards, or community rewards.
  </p>
  <p>If you are holding Earn Assets in your Bitstamp Account that is supported by Bitstamp for Inflation (“Inflation Assets”), you are eligible to receive Inflation Rewards. You will automatically be opted into the Inflation Products. You can always opt out from receiving Inflation Rewards within your Account. You remain the lawful and beneficial owner of Inflation Assets and the beneficial owner of additional assets resulting from any applicable Inflation Rewards. You do not transfer ownership of your Inflation Asset or Inflation Rewards to Bitstamp at any time.
  </p>
  <p>Descriptions of the Inflation Products specifics and related specific inflation terms for each Inflation Asset are available within the Bitstamp platform and/or on our&nbsp;
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link--colored text--normal" href="https://www.bitstamp.net/faq/#staking">FAQ page
    </a>. Availability of the Inflation Products, Inflation Assets, and Inflation Rewards may be limited by the jurisdiction where you reside. Please refer to our FAQ page for more information.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>2.3 EARN PRODUCT: governance
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>Some Blockchain protocols have adopted a governance rewards model that is designed to value and reward leaders and participants in the ecosystem and their voting participation in the ecosystem (“Governance Products”). Participants receive rewards for participating in governance of the protocol. (“Governance Rewards”).
  </p>
  <p>If you are holding Earn Assets in your Bitstamp Account that is supported by Bitstamp for Governance (“Governance Assets”), you are eligible for these Rewards, and you will automatically be opted into Governance Products. You can always opt out from receiving Governance Rewards within your Account. You remain the lawful and beneficial owner of Governance Assets and the beneficial owner of additional assets resulting from any applicable Governance Rewards. You do not transfer ownership of your Governance Asset or Governance Rewards to Bitstamp at any time.
  </p>
  <p>Descriptions of Governance Products and Governance Rewards specifics and related specific terms for Governance Assets are available within the Bitstamp platform and/or on our&nbsp;

  </p>
  <h4 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--tertiary">3 REWARDS
  </h4>
  <p>All three Earn Products (e.g., Staking Products, Inflation Products, and Governance Products) results in eligible participants accumulating Earn Rewards. Rewards are determined by the particular protocol or network that operates an Earn Asset (“Rewards Protocol”), based on individual Earn Asset. Bitstamp does not determine or issue Earn Rewards for Earn Assets held in its platform. Bitstamp is not responsible for the amount or frequency of Rewards that are earned or issued by a particular Rewards Protocol.
  </p>
  <p>For Staking Products, if a block of transactions in your Staked Assets is successfully validated, you may earn Staking Rewards calculated and granted by that Stakeable Asset’s Rewards Protocol, not Bitstamp. Your Staking Rewards is determined by the Rewards Protocol.
  </p>
  <p>For Inflation Products, if you are holding an Inflation Asset on your Account, you may earn an Inflation Reward calculated and granted by that Inflation Asset’s Rewards Protocol. Your Inflation Reward is determined by the Rewards Protocol. If you do not wish to participate in Inflation Rewards, you may affirmatively opt out of the program. Otherwise, customers with Earn Assets in eligible jurisdictions are automatically participants by holding the Inflation Asset.
  </p>
  <p>For Governance Products, if you are holding the Governance Asset on your Account, you may earn a Governance reward calculated and granted by that Governance Assets’ Rewards Protocol. Your reward is determined by the Rewards Protocol. If you do not wish to participate in Governance Rewards, you may affirmatively opt out of the program. Otherwise, you are automatically a participant by holding the Governance Asset.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Collection of Rewards Payments
    </em>. For all Earn Products, Bitstamp collects the Earn Rewards from the Rewards Protocol operating the applicable Earn Asset. Earn Rewards are determined by the Rewards Protocol. Bitstamp does not determine the amount of Earn Rewards earned under any of the Earn Services.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Timing and Distribution of Rewards Payments
    </em>. While Bitstamp does not determine the amount of Earn Reward earned on a Rewards Protocol, Bitstamp does aggregate and distribute Earn Rewards to its participants at regular intervals, which varies based on the Earn Asset held, type of Earn Reward, amount of Earn Asset participating, and time participating in the Earn Services. Bitstamp distributes Earn Rewards payments in to participating accounts at regular intervals. Earn Rewards are shown as credit in your Bitstamp Account. The percentage and timing of payments of Earn Rewards will be: (i) determined by Bitstamp at its sole discretion, depending on the type of Earn Asset and Earn Reward issued by the Rewards Protocol; (ii)&nbsp;subject to Bitstamp’s fees, as described and available in our Fee Schedule; (iii) varied by the Rewards Protocol; and (iv) further detailed in your Bitstamp Account.
  </p>
  <p>For certain Earn Assets, Bitstamp may offer you an option to choose the specific assets in which you want to receive Earn Rewards. Depending on the Rewards Protocol, Earn Rewards may be automatically contributed the Earn Services, whereupon they will be eligible to accumulate Earn Rewards. However, some Rewards Protocols do not allow Earn Assets to be automatically contributed to Earn Services. In some instances, these assets cannot participate in Earn Rewards.
  </p>
  <p>Inflation Rewards and Governance Rewards are automatically added to Earn Services process, whereupon they will be eligible to earn applicable Earn Rewards. If your balance of Earn Assets on your Account drops below the minimum balance required for participation in process, you may not receive Earn Rewards.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>No Guarantee of Rewards.
    </em> You have no right to a reward until it is received by Bitstamp. Rewards will be distributed to your account promptly after they are received by Bitstamp. Unless otherwise stated, Bitstamp will use commercially reasonable efforts to stake any Digital Currencies for which you are using Bitstamp staking services. Unless otherwise specified, the “staking rewards rate” will be disclosed on the 
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link--colored text--normal" href="https://www.bitstamp.net/bitstamp-earn/">Bitstamp Earn page
    </a>. This rate is an estimate and will likely change over time. BITSTAMP DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE STAKING REWARDS, ANY SPECIFIC STAKING REWARD, OR ANY STAKING RETURN OVER TIME, INCLUDING THE STAKING REWARDS RATES.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Tax Treatment of Proceeds from Earn Rewards
    </em>. The tax treatment of certain Virtual Currency or other Digital Asset transactions is uncertain, and it is your responsibility to determine what taxes, if any, arise from these transactions. Users are solely responsible for reporting and paying any applicable taxes arising from staking through Bitstamp staking services and all related transactions (e.g., any exchange or sale of your staked ETH), and acknowledge that Bitstamp does not provide investment, legal, or tax advice to you in connection with such election to participate. Bitstamp may, however, introduce Users to a tax adviser that can offer Users support related to tax questions. In such a situation, Users will enter into a separate contractual agreement with the vendor, and Bitstamp is not liable for any advice or recommendations provided to users. You should conduct your own due diligence and consult your advisors before making any investment decision including whether to participate in staking and related transactions.
  </p>
  <h4 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--tertiary">4 NO GUARANTEE, REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY
  </h4>
  <p>You agree and understand that Earn Rewards are based on the individual Earn Assets’ Rewards Protocol. Bitstamp has no control or discretion over the amount of Earn Rewards earned in a particular Earn Rewards period. You further agree and understand that Bitstamp does not guarantee that you will receive Earn Rewards and that the applicable percentage of Earn Rewards (i) is an estimate only and does not constitute a guarantee, warranty or representation of any sort, (ii) may change at any time for reasons within or outside of Bitstamp’s control, and (iii)&nbsp;may be more or less than the actual rewards received from the Rewards Protocols. You have no right to an Earn Reward. If and when Earn Rewards are accumulated, the portion of an Earn Reward that your Earn Assets have accumulated will be distributed to your Bitstamp Account. Timing for Earn Rewards distributions will vary by the type of Earn Asset. Please refer to the Bitstamp Earn FAQ for updated information about timing of Earn Rewards distributions and any fees related to Earn Services.

  </p>
  <h4 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--tertiary">5 LOCKUP PERIODS &amp; LIQUIDITY
  </h4>
  <p>If you choose to participate in Earn Services, your Earn Assets may be subject to a specific Lockup Period, meaning you may be required to pledge your Earn Assets to the applicable process, and your Earn Assets will become locked on the applicable Rewards Protocol for a period of time. Bitstamp has no control over the duration or end date of the Lockup period, which will ultimately be determined by the applicable Rewards Protocol. For some Earn Assets, you might be unable to opt out of Earn Services participation. Bitstamp will not refund or replace your locked Earn Assets you wish to withdraw from the Earn Services. You might not be able to trade, transfer, or otherwise access your Earn Assets during the Lockup period. Accessing your locked Earn Assets may result in a loss of any Earn Rewards accrued until that point. Bitstamp is not responsible for any decrease in the value of your Earn Assets or any Earn Rewards associated with allowing you the ability to exchange or sell your locked Earn Assets.
  </p>
  <p>For more information about Earn Assets subject to Lockup provisions, please review the individual Earn Asset’s FAQs.
  </p>
  <h4 class="text-subtitle text-subtitle--tertiary">6 RISKS
  </h4>
  <p>In addition to the Risk section and Risk disclosure in the Bitstamp Terms of Use, Earn Services involve some specific risks, which are addressed below. With the acceptance of these Earn Terms, you acknowledge that you are aware that Earn Services, Earn Assets, Rewards Protocols, and related technologies are new and untested. In addition to the risks set forth here, there are risks that Bitstamp cannot foresee, and it is unreasonable to believe that such risks could be foreseeable. Unanticipated risks may arise. 
    <strong>With the acceptance of these Earn Terms, you acknowledge and confirm that Earn Services, Earn Assets, and Rewards Protocols carry significant inherent risks up to and including loss of the Earn Assets you have contributed to the program, and you accept those risks
    </strong>. Bitstamp disclaims all liability for losses resulting from the below risks. Under certain circumstances, third-party providers may indemnify Bitstamp for certain losses sustained in the process. In other circumstances, these third-party providers may not indemnify losses. In the event a loss is indemnified, Bitstamp will pass on the recovery in an amount appropriate to the value lost. Bitstamp is not otherwise obligated to indemnify you from losses suffered from participating in Bitstamp Earn.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>6.1 Slashing Penalty
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>Some Rewards Protocol may determine penalties for certain events associated with the participation in Rewards Protocol processes (e.g., unavailability, slow, incorrect or malicious performance) (“Slashing Penalty”) This may occur if an Earn Service has been erroneously operated, the transaction validator incorrectly validated a transaction and/or in any other case determined by the Rewards Protocol, that may result in a Slashing Penalty, non-payment of the Earn Reward and/or partial or complete loss of Earn Assets.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>6.2 Node Downtime
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>Downtime occurs when a validator is unavailable to sign transactions on a blockchain for a certain period of time (“Node Downtime”). Expectations for the uptime of a validator are dependent upon the Rewards Protocol. If a node remains unavailable for long enough, Earn Rewards may not be received in part or in full and/or a node may be subject to penalties, including downtime slashing. Earn Assets are not at risk in case of Node Downtime. Node Downtime often occurs if a node’s cloud infrastructure goes offline, or a node is out of sync with the chain. Not all Rewards Protocols consider Node Downtime a slashing offense. Bitstamp has taken steps to minimize potential Node Downtime. If losses occur from Node Downtime, and Bitstamp’s third-party provider indemnifies this loss, Bitstamp will pass along apportioned reimbursement to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>6.3 Critical Bugs
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>Earn Services are based on various Rewards Protocols. As such, any malfunction, unintended function or unexpected functioning of the Rewards Protocols and/or their networks may consequently cause Earn Services to malfunction or function in an unexpected or unintended manner.
  </p>
  <p>Hackers and other groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with Rewards Protocols, Earn Services, and Earn Assets in any number of ways, including, without limitation, denial of service attacks, Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks or consensus-based attacks.
  </p>
  <p>Critical bugs including, but not limited to, the ones described above may result in a loss of part or all Earn Assets.
  </p>

You acknowledge and agree that Bitstamp may exercise any such governance decision and/or voting right on your behalf, and you have no rights whatsoever with regard to the governance decisions derived from your Earn Assets. Bitstamp’s governance decisions made on your behalf will be made in accordance with Bitstamp Policies.

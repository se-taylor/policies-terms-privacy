      </p>
      <p>In order to use any Services, you must create and maintain an account through the Services (“
        <strong>Bittrex Account
        </strong>”). To create or maintain your Bittrex Account, or enable functions on your Bittrex Account, you will be required to provide Bittrex with certain information and documentation, including, as applicable, the information and documentation associated with identity verification and other screening procedures described in Section 3.3, below. You will: (a) create a unique password; (b) provide complete and accurate information; (c) promptly update any information you have provided, including your email address, so that the information is complete and accurate at all times; (d) maintain the security of your Bittrex Account by not sharing your password with others, safeguarding your personal identifying information, and protecting your password, API keys, and any other information used to access the Services from unauthorized access or use; (e) ensure that any API keys you enable are properly scoped to grant only those permissions that are necessary for the service(s) you use and are disabled if no longer in use; (f) promptly notify Bittrex if you discover or suspect any unauthorized access or use of your Bittrex Account or any security breaches related to your Bittrex Account; and (g) be responsible for all activities that occur under your Bittrex Account, and accept all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access to your Bittrex Account. For the avoidance of doubt, Bittrex will not be responsible for any loss due to the compromise of your login credentials.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3.2. Enhanced Security
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>Bittrex may offer optional enhanced security features for your Bittrex Account (including, for example, two-factor authentication). Bittrex encourages, but may not require, you to use any such enhanced security features. If you do enable enhanced security features, it is your responsibility to ensure the security of, and your continuous control over, any device or account that may be associated with the enhanced security features.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3.3. Identity Verification and USA PATRIOT Act Disclosure 
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>Depending on the functions that you seek to enable on your account and Bittrex’s risk determination, Bittrex may, in its discretion, require identity verification and other screening procedures with respect to you or transactions associated with your Bittrex Account. These verification and screening procedures may include, without limitation, checking the information you provide against the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list maintained by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Persons list, and any similar list issued by any U.S. governmental authority or any other governmental authority prohibiting or limiting business activities or transactions with any persons. You may be required to provide Bittrex with certain personal information, including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, email address, date of birth, taxpayer identification number, government identification number, photograph of your government-issued ID or other photographic proof of your identity, and information regarding your bank account. You hereby authorize Bittrex, directly or through a third party, to make any inquiries Bittrex considers necessary to verify your identity and/or protect against fraud, including but not limited to: (a) query identity information contained in public reports (e.g., your name, address, past addresses, or date of birth); (b) query account information associated with your linked bank account (e.g., name or account balance); and (c) take action Bittrex reasonably deems necessary based on the results of such inquiries and reports. You further authorize any and all third parties to which such inquiries or requests may be directed to fully respond to such inquiries or requests. Bittrex will have no liability or responsibility for any permanent or temporary inability to access or use any Services, including your inability to withdraw Tokens or execute Trades, as a result of any identity verification or other screening procedures.
      </p>
      <p>Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person or legal entity who opens an account. This information is used to assist the United States government in the fight against the funding of terrorism and money-laundering activities. What this means for you: Bittrex will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver’s license or other identifying documents. Similarly, Bittrex will ask for the names, addresses, dates of birth, and other identification information of the beneficial owners of any legal entity. If all required documentation and information is not provided, you may not be able to open a Bittrex account.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3.4. Responsibility for Account Activities
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>You will be bound by, and hereby authorize Bittrex to accept and rely on, any agreements, instructions, orders, authorizations and any other actions made, provided or taken by anyone who has accessed or used your Bittrex Account regardless of whether the access is authorized or unauthorized. Upon receipt of written notice from you that the security of your account has been compromised, Bittrex will take reasonable steps to protect your account, including, for example, to cease to allow actions initiated using any compromised account passwords. But, the first sentence of this Section will continue to apply to any other account password and any substitute password issued to replace the compromised account password.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3.5. Number of Bittrex Accounts
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>Bittrex may, in its sole discretion, limit the number of Bittrex Accounts that you may hold, maintain, or acquire.

          <strong> RISK DISCLOSURES; ASSUMPTION OF RISKS; RELEASE OF BITTREX
          </strong>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Trading cryptocurrency, cryptographic tokens and other digital rights or assets (“
        <strong>Tokens
        </strong>”), and use of other Services provided by Bittrex, involves significant risks and potential for financial losses, including without limitation the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The features, functions, characteristics, operation, use and other properties of any Token (“
          <strong>Token Properties
          </strong>”) and the software, networks, protocols, systems, and other technology (including, if applicable, any blockchain) (“
          <strong>Underlying Technology
          </strong>”) used to administer, create, issue, transfer, cancel, use or transact in any Token may be complex, technical or difficult to understand or evaluate.
        </li>
        <li>Any Token and its Underlying Technology may be vulnerable to hacking, cyber attack or other attacks on the security, integrity or operation of the Token or its Underlying Technology (“
          <strong>Attacks
          </strong>”), including Attacks using computing power sufficient to overwhelm the normal operation of a blockchain or other Underlying Technology.
        </li>
        <li>Due to the nature of virtual currency, there is an increased risk of fraud or Attacks and your Tokens or the value of your Tokens may be irretrievably stolen.
        </li>
        <li>Any Token, Token Properties or Underlying Technology may change or otherwise cease to operate as expected due to a change made to the Underlying Technology, a change made using features or functions built into the Underlying Technology or a change resulting from an Attack. These changes may include, without limitation, a “fork” or “rollback” of a Token or blockchain.
        </li>
        <li>Any Token may be cancelled, lost or double spent, or otherwise lose all or most of their value, due to forks, rollbacks, Attacks, changes to Token Properties or failure of the Token to operate as intended.
        </li>
        <li>Bittrex may suspend or cease to support the transfer, storage or trading of any Token at any time at Bittrex’s discretion. Other exchanges and service providers may do the same.
        </li>
        <li>Bittrex may not support metacoins, colored coins or other Tokens, or their related side chains or other Underlying Technology that are based on a fork, enhancement, or derivative of a different Token or Underlying Technology (“Derivative Protocols”) even if the Derivative Protocol is based on a Token that is supported by Bittrex. Other exchanges or service providers may do the same.
        </li>
        <li>Bittrex may suspend or reject your transaction requests, suspend or cease support for Tokens, or suspend or terminate your access to the Services to comply with applicable laws or regulations or an order from law enforcement or other governmental authority, for other reasons as specified in these Terms or otherwise at Bittrex’s discretion.
        </li>
        <li>You may be unable to withdraw Tokens or complete Orders (as defined below) prior to Bittrex ceasing to support transfer of any such Tokens, or you may be unable to withdraw Tokens or fiat currency prior to Bittrex terminating any Services or your access to your Bittrex Account, resulting in the loss of any such Tokens or fiat currency remaining in your Bittrex Account.
        </li>
        <li>Any Token may decrease in value or lose all of its value due to various factors including discovery of wrongful conduct, market manipulation, changes to Token Properties or perceived value of Token Properties, Attacks, suspension or cessation of support for a Token by Bittrex or other exchanges or service providers, and other factors outside the control of Bittrex.
        </li>
        <li>Any Token may decrease in value or lose all of its value due to legislative or regulatory activity, or other government action. Government regulation of Tokens is unsettled and rapidly evolving.
        </li>
        <li>Any Token may be lost if sent to the wrong address (for example but without limitation, if the address is improperly formatted, contains errors, or is intended to be used for a different type of Token). For more detail about sending Tokens to an address intended for a different type of Token, please see Bittrex’s Deposit Recovery Policy 
          <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/115000961172" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here
          </a>.
        </li>
        <li>You may be prevented from sending a transaction request, or your transaction request or email may not be received by Bittrex or the Services, due to hardware, software or services issues (including, without limitation, Internet and other network connectivity issues).
        </li>
        <li>Your transaction request or email to Bittrex or the Services may be lost, intercepted or altered during transmission.
        </li>
        <li>Unauthorized third parties may access or use your Bittrex Account and effect transactions without your knowledge or authorization, whether by obtaining the password to your Bittrex Account, obtaining control over another device or account used by you in connection with any enhanced security measures enabled for your account, obtaining control over your API keys, or by other methods. You should regularly review your Bittrex Account balance and transaction history and notify Bittrex immediately if you believe your account has been compromised.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The risks described in this Section 4 may result in loss of Tokens, decrease in or loss of all value for Tokens, inability to access or transfer Tokens, inability to trade Tokens, inability to receive financial benefits available to other Token holders, and other financial losses to you. You hereby assume and agree that Bittrex will have no responsibility or liability for, such risks. You hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge any and all claims, whether known or unknown to you, against Bittrex, its Affiliates and their respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives related to any of the risks set forth herein. You waive application of Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California, or any similar statute or law of any other jurisdiction. Section 1542 reads as follows: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY.”
      </p>
      <p>You represent and warrant that you have: (a) the necessary technical expertise and ability to review and evaluate the security, integrity and operation of any Tokens that you decide to acquire or trade; and (b) the knowledge, experience, understanding, professional advice and information to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any Token or trade. You accept the risk of trading Tokens by using the Services and are responsible for conducting your own independent analysis of the risks specific to the Tokens and the Services. You should not acquire or trade any Tokens unless you have sufficient financial resources and can afford to lose all value of the Tokens.
      </p>
      <p>Bittrex’s decision to support transfer, storage or trading of any particular Token through the Services does not indicate Bittrex’s approval or disapproval of the Token or the integrity, security or operation of the Token or its Underlying Technology. The risks associated with Tokens and trading Tokens apply notwithstanding Bittrex’s decision to support a particular Token. Further, any information provided by Bittrex about a particular Token, including but not limited to customer support articles, blogs, social media posts, or links to news articles or other content, does not constitute trading advice or an endorsement of that Token. Bittrex does not provide trading advice, does not have any fiduciary duty to you or any other user and does not make any warranty about the suitability of any Token for trading or ownership by you. You should conduct due diligence before deciding whether to transact in a particular Token.

        <strong>6.1. Initial Account Funding
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>In order to engage in a Trade (as defined below) you must first transfer Tokens that are supported by the Services or fiat currencies that are supported by the Services to your Bittrex Account. The Services associated with your Bittrex Account include a wallet service provided by Bittrex (“
        <strong>Hosted Wallet”
        </strong>). The Hosted Wallet will permit you to generate one or more addresses to which Tokens may be transferred from an account, wallet or address not hosted or controlled by Bittrex or a bank account at a financial institution (“
        <strong>External Account
        </strong>”). Bittrex may require that you verify your control over an External Account or satisfy other verification or screening requirements prior to enabling transfers between the applicable External Account and your Hosted Wallet or your Bittrex Account (any such External Account, an “
        <strong>Approved External Account
        </strong>”).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.2. Deposits
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>You may periodically at your discretion transfer from an Approved External Account to your Hosted Wallet any Tokens that are supported for transfer and storage using the Services. If you transfer to your Hosted Wallet any Tokens that are not supported by the Services, such Tokens may be permanently lost. You may periodically at your discretion transfer fiat currencies that are supported by the Services from an Approved External Account to your Bittrex Account for transfer and storage using the Services. You will not be entitled to receive any interest or other fees on any fiat currency held in your Bittrex Account or any Tokens held in your Hosted Wallet, even if Bittrex receives interest or other fees from any third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.3. Withdrawals
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>You are required to retain in your Hosted Wallet a sufficient quantity of Tokens and in your Bittrex Account a sufficient quantity of fiat currency necessary to satisfy any open orders (and applicable Bittrex fees). In addition, there may be limits on (a) the amounts that you are able to withdraw on a daily or other periodic basis, (b) the amount or timing of withdrawals made shortly after deposits have been made, or (c) other limits based on risk mitigation, fraud prevention and other security protocols implemented by Bittrex. You may contact Bittrex by filing a support request at 
        <a href="https://support.bittrex.com">https://support.bittrex.com
        </a> in the event any of our security protocols cause inconvenience or hardship to explore alternative methods for mitigating a particular security issue identified by Bittrex. Otherwise, you may periodically, at your discretion, withdraw Tokens by transferring Tokens from your Hosted Wallet to an address not controlled by Bittrex (“
        <strong>External Address
        </strong>”), and you may withdraw fiat currency by transferring fiat currency from your Bittrex Account to an Approved External Account. Bittrex may require you to verify that any External Address to which you seek to transfer Tokens is associated with an Approved External Account. You hereby authorize Bittrex to use your Hosted Wallet to send to any External Address specified by you using the Services, the number of Tokens specified by you using the Services. Bittrex is not able to reverse any transfers and will not have any responsibility or liability if you have instructed Bittrex to send Tokens to an address that is incorrect, improperly formatted, erroneous or intended for a different type of Token. You hereby authorize Bittrex to use your Bittrex Account to send to any Approved External Account specified by you using the Services, the amount of fiat currency specified by you using the Services. Bittrex is not able to reverse any transfers and will not have any responsibility or liability if you have instructed Bittrex to send fiat currency to an External Account that is incorrect, improperly formatted or erroneous.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.4. Prohibited Transfers
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>You will not attempt or cause an inbound or outbound transfer of Tokens or fiat currency to or from Bittrex where you have reason to know that any person or entity involved in the transfer—whether directly or indirectly—is subject to U.S. economic sanctions restrictions, including but not limited to the following persons or entities: (1) the originator of the transfer, (2) the recipient of the transfer, and/or (3) the Token exchange, hosted wallet service provider, bank, or other financial institution involved in the transfer.
      </p>
      <p>Person or entities may be subject to U.S. economic sanctions restrictions if, for example, they are (1) a resident, citizen, or otherwise located in a jurisdiction that is embargoed by the United States (e.g., Iran, Cuba, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine), (2) subject to United States blocking sanctions regardless of whether they are listed on an Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned parties list, (3) owned or controlled by a person or entity subject to U.S. blocking sanctions, or (4) placed on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s&nbsp; Denied Persons List or Entity List.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.5. Other Terms Applicable to Transfers
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>You will be responsible for: (a) paying all fees charged by any third party service provider associated with any External Account or External Address as well as for paying any fees charged by Bittrex for any transfers; (b) ensuring that any inbound and outbound transfers are handled in compliance with Bittrex requirements, third party service provider requirements or Token requirements; (c) ensuring that the address to which any Tokens are to be transferred is properly formatted and suitable for the type of Token being transferred; and (d) ensuring that there are no errors in any of the transfer instructions you provide using the Services. In the event you fail to comply with any requirements of this Section 6.5, the transferred Tokens or fiat currency, as applicable, may be permanently lost. The timing for completing any transfer will depend on third-party actions that are outside the control of Bittrex and Bittrex makes no guarantee regarding the amount of time it may take to complete any transfer. Bittrex may cancel or reverse transfers, impose limits on the amount of any inbound or outbound transfers, or suspend or terminate the ability to transfer Tokens into or out of your Hosted Wallet or fiat currency into or out of your Bittrex Account or otherwise use the Services, in order to comply with applicable laws or regulations, a subpoena or other order from law enforcement or other governmental authority, if Bittrex reasonably believes a transaction error has occurred, or otherwise at Bittrex’s discretion. In the event your transfer is cancelled or reversed, Bittrex has no obligation to allow you to perform a substitute transfer or to compensate you for any related losses, unrealized gains, damages, expenses, or any other liabilities.
      </p>
      <p>If your payment fails in whole or part due to insufficient funds or if you reverse a transfer from your bank account, you authorize Bittrex to cancel the transfer or complete it by debiting your Hosted Wallet, Bittrex Account, or External Accounts. In doing so, Bittrex also may convert assets in your Hosted Wallet or Bittrex Account in order to satisfy any debts that you may owe to Bittrex as a result of failed payments or transfers. You are responsible for any non-sufficient funds, overdraft, or other fees charged by your payment provider.

        <strong>6.6.&nbsp; Custodianship of Tokens and Fiat Currency
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>Bittrex does not own any Tokens or fiat currency that it holds for its customers. Although Bittrex controls the private keys for the blockchain addresses for deposited Tokens, you retain ownership and control of your Tokens and fiat currency while in the custody of Bittrex subject to these Terms and applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>Your Tokens and fiat currency are tracked and maintained on internal ledgers maintained by Bittrex. Bittrex has no obligation to segregate your fiat currency in a separate bank account or to segregate any of your Tokens at a separate blockchain address. Fiat currency and Tokens are fungible with other like fiat currency and Tokens, and, to the extent you are entitled to withdraw or otherwise receive any funds or Tokens, you are entitled to a quantity of fiat currency or Tokens but not any particular fiat currency or Tokens. You will not claim ownership of any particular Tokens based on the blockchain address, blockchain transfer record or other basis.

        <strong>7.1. Orders; Fees
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>A “
        <strong>Trade
        </strong>” is an exchange of Tokens, or an exchange of fiat currency for Tokens, in each case for which trading is supported on the Services between you and another user of the Services whereby you dispose of certain Tokens or fiat currency and acquire different Tokens or fiat currency. An “
        <strong>Order
        </strong>” is created when you enter an instruction to effect a Trade using the Services. When you enter an Order you authorize Bittrex to execute a Trade on a spot basis for all or a portion of the number of Tokens or the amount of fiat currency specified in your Order in accordance with such Order. You agree to pay Bittrex any applicable fees for Trades and authorize Bittrex to deduct any such fees from your Hosted Wallet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.2. No Broker or Fiduciary Relationship
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>Bittrex is not your broker, intermediary, agent, or advisor and has no fiduciary relationship or obligation to you in connection with any Trades or other decisions or activities effected by you using the Services. No communication or information provided to you by Bittrex is intended as, or shall be considered or construed as, advice. Please refer to Section 4 for a summary of some of the risks you should consider when choosing whether to use our Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.3. Order Confirmation
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>Before an Order is placed, the Services will generate and display a confirmation dialogue box summarizing the details of the proposed transaction, including the type and amount of Tokens you are seeking to dispose of, the type and amount of Tokens or fiat currency that you are willing to accept in exchange for the Tokens or fiat currency you are seeking to dispose of, Bittrex’s estimated fees if the entire Order were to be executed, and the total number and type of Tokens or the amount of fiat currency, as applicable, that will be transferred out of your Hosted Wallet if the entire Order were to be executed. Your Order will be placed upon confirmation of the Order summary via the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that the failure of the Services to provide such Order summary or confirmation shall not prejudice or invalidate any Order submitted by you or any Trade completed based on such Order.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.4. Order Matching and Trade Execution
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>Upon placement of an Order, your Bittrex Account will be updated to reflect the open Order and your Order will be included in Bittrex’s order book for matching with Orders from other users. If all or a portion of your Order is matched with another user, the Services will execute a Trade. Upon execution of a Trade, your Bittrex Account will be updated to reflect that the Order has either been closed due to having been fully executed or updated to reflect any partial fulfillment of the Order. Orders will remain open until fully executed or cancelled in accordance with Section 7.5 below. For purposes of effectuating a Trade, you authorize Bittrex to take temporary control of the Tokens that you are disposing of in the Trade. Bittrex trades its own corporate cryptocurrency assets on the Bittrex platform. Periodically, as an accommodation to customers in low liquidity markets, Bittrex also will act as principal in certain transactions to effectuate trader placed Orders that have gone unfulfilled for a certain period of time. In any of these transactions, Bittrex does not have any special priority and is subject to the same pricing and timing as all other Trades. These transactions are conducted based only on market data and with no access to inside information. Bittrex does not engage in any front-running.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.5. Cancellations
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>You may only cancel an order initiated via the Services if such cancellation occurs before your Order has been matched with an Order from another user. Once your Order has been matched with an Order from another user, you may not change, withdraw, or cancel your authorization for Bittrex to complete such Order. If any order has been partially matched, you may cancel the unmatched portion of the Order unless and until the unmatched portion has been matched. Bittrex reserves the right to refuse any cancellation request associated with a market Order after you have submitted such Order.

Further, Bittrex reserves the right to debit your Hosted Wallet or Bittrex Account and/or withhold Tokens or fiat currency you transfer to or from your Hosted Wallet or Bittrex Account to satisfy any unpaid debts owed to Bittrex.

      <p>You consent to receive electronically all communications, agreements, documents, receipts, notices, and disclosures (collectively, “
        <strong>Communications
        </strong>”) that Bittrex provides in connection with this Agreement, your Bittrex Account or any Services, including updates Bittrex makes to this Agreement. You agree that Bittrex may provide these Communications to you by posting them via the Services, by emailing them to you at the email address you provide, sending them using an app or other messaging service to your account on the app or messaging service, and/or by sending an SMS or text message to a mobile phone number that you provide. Your carrier’s normal messaging, data, and other rates and fees may apply to any mobile Communications. You should maintain copies of electronic Communications by printing a paper copy or saving an electronic copy. You may also contact Bittrex’s Support Team to request additional electronic copies of Communications or, for a fee, paper copies of Communications (as described below) by filing a support request at 
        <a href="https://support.bittrex.com">https://support.bittrex.com

        <strong>12.2. Hardware and Software Requirements
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>In order to access and retain electronic Communications, you will need a computer with an Internet connection that has a current web browser with cookies enabled and 128-bit encryption. You will also need to have a valid email address on file with Bittrex and have sufficient storage space to save past Communications or an installed printer to print them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>12.3. Withdrawal of Consent
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>You may withdraw your consent to receive electronic Communications by sending a withdrawal notice to our Support Team by filing a support request at 
        <a href="https://support.bittrex.com">https://support.bittrex.com
        </a>. If you decline or withdraw consent to receive electronic Communications, Bittrex may suspend or terminate your use of the Services.

      <p>
        <strong>12.4. Requesting Paper Copies
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>If, after you consent to receive Communications electronically, you would like a paper copy of a Communication that Bittrex previously sent you, you may request a copy within thirty (30) days after the date Bittrex provided the Communication to you by filing a support request with Bittrex at 
        <a href="https://support.bittrex.com">https://support.bittrex.com
        </a>. In order for Bittrex to send paper copies to you, you must have a current street address on file with Bittrex. Please note that our Services operate exclusively online and it is very burdensome for Bittrex to produce paper copies of Communications. Therefore, if you request paper copies, you agree that Bittrex may charge you a processing fee, in the amount described in the Fee Schedule at 
        <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/115000199651" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bittrex.com/fees

      <p>
        <strong>12.5. Updating Contact Information
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>It is your responsibility to keep your email address and/or mobile phone number on file with Bittrex up to date so that Bittrex can communicate with you electronically. If Bittrex sends you an electronic Communication but you do not receive it because your email address or mobile phone number on file is incorrect, out of date, blocked by your service provider, or you are otherwise unable to receive electronic Communications, Bittrex will be deemed to have provided the Communication to you. Please note that if you use a spam filter that blocks or re-routes emails from senders not listed in your email address book, you must add Bittrex to your email address book so that you will be able to receive the Communications Bittrex sends to you. You can update your email address, mobile phone number, or street address at any time by filing a support request at 
        <a href="https://support.bittrex.com">https://support.bittrex.com
        </a>. Bittrex may require you to provide certain identity verification information in order to effectuate such requested updates. If your email address or mobile phone number becomes invalid such that electronic Communications sent to you by Bittrex are returned, Bittrex may deem your account to be inactive, and you may not be able to complete any transaction via our Services until Bittrex receives a valid, working email address or mobile phone number from you.

        <strong>Please read the following Section carefully because it waives any right to participate in any class action or other representative action or proceeding.&nbsp; Unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below, this Section also requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief, including by precluding you from suing in court or having a jury trial.

        <strong>Arbitration of Disputes. 
        </strong>With only limited exceptions as described in Section 19.3, all Disputes between you and Bittrex must be resolved by binding arbitration and not in a court of general jurisdiction. By agreeing to binding arbitration both you and Bittrex waive any and all right to a jury trial or to participate in a class action. This Agreement affects interstate commerce and the enforceability of this Section 19.2 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, 
        <em>et seq

        </strong>”) to Bittrex by filing a support ticket at&nbsp;
        <a href="https://support.bittrex.com/">https://support.bittrex.com

The Notice must (i) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (ii) describe the nature and basis of the Dispute; and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought. Any notice by Bittrex to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and Bittrex cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after receiving such Notice, either party may submit the Dispute to binding arbitration as provided herein.

        </strong>
        <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arbitrator Selection and Rules.
        </strong> Arbitration of Disputes will be administered by Judicial Dispute Resolution LLC, a Washington limited liability company (JDR), and resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before a single, mutually agreed arbitrator from JDR.&nbsp; If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator from JDR, the arbitrator shall be selected by JDR. The arbitration, although administered by JDR, shall be conducted in accordance with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) Commercial Arbitration Rules (including, as applicable if you are a consumer under those rules, the Consumer Arbitration Rules) (“
        <strong>AAA Rules
        </strong>”) modified as appropriate to refer to JDR rather than AAA as the administrator of the proceedings and to remove any requirement to have AAA review, certify or register these Terms. The most recent version of the AAA Rules is available 
        <a href="https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Commercial%20Rules.pdf">here
        </a> and incorporated by reference.&nbsp; The most recent version of the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules is available 
        <a href="https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer-Rules-Web.pdf">here
        </a> and is incorporated by reference if you are a consumer under the AAA Rules. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the AAA Rules or waive your opportunity to read the AAA Rules and waive any claim that the AAA Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and the AAA Rules, these Terms shall govern.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        <strong>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scope and Authority. 
        </strong>As limited by the FAA, these Terms, and the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability and resolve any dispute about whether a claim or action is excepted from arbitration pursuant to Section 19.3, below, and to grant any remedy and award any relief that would be available in court for the claims presented in arbitration. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator is bound by this provision.

      <p>
        <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearings and Location.
        </strong>&nbsp; Whether to hold a hearing, the type of hearing (telephonic or in-person), and a party’s right to request a hearing where the AAA Rules otherwise call for resolution of the Dispute solely on the basis of documents submitted by the parties will all be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules.&nbsp; Unless otherwise ordered by an arbitrator or required by AAA Rules, all in-person arbitration hearings will be held in King County, Washington.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        <strong>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confidentiality.
        </strong> The arbitration may allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, Bittrex and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments, and awards, including information gathered, prepared, and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

        </strong>
        <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fees and Costs.
        </strong> The party that initiates arbitration will pay any administrator filing fee and you and Bittrex will share equally any other fees or costs charged by the administrator or arbitrator. If you are a consumer under the AAA Rules, the filing fee and any other administration costs will be split in accordance with the fee schedule in the AAA Rules. Each party will be responsible for its own costs of counsel and other costs associated with arbitration of the Dispute.

      <p>
        <strong>19.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excepted Claims. 
        </strong>Notwithstanding Section 19.2, there is no requirement to arbitrate, and you and Bittrex may bring (a) an individual small claims action in the small claims court in your and Bittrex’s respective county of residence as provided in the AAA Rules, or (b) an action seeking only a temporary restraining order or injunction for alleged breach of confidentiality obligations or for alleged infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property in any court having jurisdiction; provided that, in each case, the action is brought as an individual action and not on a class or representative basis.

      <p>
        <strong>19.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time Bar.&nbsp; Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and Bittrex will not have the right to assert the claim.

        <strong>19.5 
        </strong>
        <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Severability
        </strong>. If any portion of this Section 19 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 19 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 19; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 19 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought outside of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 19 will be enforceable.

      <h2>2. KEY DEFINITIONS
      </h2>
      <p>Set out below are key definitions of certain data protection terms which appear in this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>“
        <strong>Consent Form
        </strong>” refers to separate documents which we might from time to time provide you where we ask for your explicit consent for any processing which is not for purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>“
        <strong>Data subjects
        </strong>” means living individuals (i.e. 
        <strong>natural persons
        </strong>) about whom we collect and process personal data.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>“
        <strong>Data controller
        </strong>” or “
        <strong>controller
        </strong>” means any entity or individual who determines the purposes for which, and the manner in which, any personal data is processed.
      </p>
      <p>“
        <strong>Data processor
        </strong>” or “
        <strong>processor
        </strong>” means any entity or individual that processes data on our behalf and on our instructions (we being the data controller).
      </p>
      <p>“
        <strong>Personal data
        </strong>” means data relating to a living individual (i.e. 
        <strong>natural person
        </strong>) who can be identified from the data (information) we hold or possess. This includes, but is not limited to, your name and surname (including maiden name where applicable), address, date of birth, nationality, gender, civil status, tax status, identity card number &amp; passport number, contact details (including mobile and home phone number and personal email address), photographic image, bank account details, emergency contact information as well as online identifiers. The term “
        <strong>personal information
        </strong>”, where and when used in this Privacy Policy, shall be taken have the same meaning as personal data.
      </p>
      <p>“
        <strong>Processing
        </strong>” means any activity that involves use of personal data. It includes obtaining, recording or holding the data, or carrying out any operation or set of operations on the data including, organizing, amending, retrieving, using, disclosing, erasing or destroying it. Processing also includes transferring personal data to third parties.
      </p>
      <p>“
        <strong>Sensitive personal data
        </strong>”, “
        <strong>sensitive data

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note that personal data does not include information relating to a legal person (for example, a company or other legal entity). In that regard, information such as a company name, its company number, registered address and VAT number does not amount to personal data in terms of both the Act and the GDPR. Therefore, the collection and use of information strictly pertaining to a legal person does not give rise to data controller obligations at law. 
        </strong>
        <strong>Naturally, we will still treat any and all such information in a confidential and secure manner. 
        </strong>
      </p>

      </p>
      <h2>9.&nbsp;DATA RETENTION
      </h2>
      <h3>How long will you use my personal data for?
        <strong>&nbsp;
        </strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Please note that we consider our relationship with you to be an ongoing and continuous customer relationship, until terminated.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for (i.e. the ongoing service provision) and, 
        <strong>
          <u>thereafter
          </u>
        </strong>, for the purpose of satisfying any legal, accounting, tax and reporting requirements or obligations to which we may be subject and/or to the extent that we may also need to retain your personal data to be able to assert, exercise or defend possible future legal claims against or otherwise involving you.
      </p>
      <p>By and large, our retention of your personal data shall not exceed the period of 
        <strong>
          <u>seven (7) years
          </u>
        </strong> from the date of the termination of your relationship with us (which would typically arise from the closure/de-registration of your account on the Platform). This period of retention enables us to use the data in question for the possible filing, exercise or defense of legal claims (taking into account the timeframe of applicable statutes of limitation and prescriptive periods). In certain cases though, we may need to retain your data for a period of up to 
        <strong>
          <u>ten (10) years
          </u>
        </strong> in order to comply with applicable accounting and tax laws (this will primarily consist of your Transaction Data).
      </p>
      <p>In the event that Bittrex’s activities are held by competent legislators and regulators to amount to a ‘relevant activity’ at law, we will retain your AML and KYC Data for the duration of your business relationship with us and for a further period of five years following its termination and, in certain instances, for a maximum period of ten (10) years post-termination if mandated by the FIAU or other applicable competent authority. We may need to revise this AML retention period in the event of applicable legal or regulatory developments, but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.
      </p>
      <p>In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete your data. See below for further information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Kindly contact our DPCP for further details about the retention periods that we apply.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <h3>Data Minimization
      </h3>
      <p>Whenever and to the extent possible, we anonymize the data which we hold about you when it is no longer necessary to identify you from the data which we hold about you (
        <strong>anonymous data
        </strong>).
      </p>
      <p>In some circumstances, we may even anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice.
      </p>
      <h2>10. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
      </h2>
      <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under certain data protection laws in relation to your personal data.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Request access to your personal data.
          </em>

          <em>Request transfer of your personal data
          </em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Right to withdraw consent
          </em>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at 
        <a style="background-color: transparent; color: #0066cc; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: underline; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;" href="mailto:privacy@bittrex.com">privacy@bittrex.com
        </a>. These rights are explained below.
      </p>
      <h3>No Fee usually required
      </h3>
      <p>You will not normally have to pay a fee to exercise your data subject rights.
      </p>
      <p>However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in the above circumstances.
      </p>
      <h3>What we may need from you
      </h3>
      <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other data subject rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
      </p>
      <h3>Time limit to Respond
      </h3>
      <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within the period of one month from receipt of the request.
      </p>
      <p>Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
      </p>
      <h3>Your Legal Rights
      </h3>
      <p>You have the right to:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Request access 
          </strong>to your personal data (commonly known as a “
          <em>data subject access request
          </em>”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. You may send an email to&nbsp;
          <u>
            <a href="mailto:privacy@bittrex.com">privacy@bittrex.com
            </a>
          </u> requesting information as the personal data which we process.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Right to information
          </strong> when collecting and processing personal data about you from publicly accessible or third party sources. When this takes place, we will inform you, within a reasonable and practicable timeframe, about the third party or publicly accessible source from which we have collected your personal data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Request correction or rectification 
          </strong>of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected and/or updated, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. As mentioned, it is in your interest to keep us informed of any changes or updates to your personal data which occur during the course of your relationship with us.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Request erasure 
          </strong>of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where:
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>there is no good reason for us continuing to process it;
            </li>
            <li>you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below);
            </li>
            <li>we may have processed your information unlawfully; or
            </li>
            <li>we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.
            </li>
          </ul>
          Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. These may include instances where continued processing is necessary in order to be able to:
          <ul>
            <li>comply with a legal or regulatory obligation to which we are subject; or
            </li>
            <li>establish, exercise or defence of legal claims.&nbsp;
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Object to processing 
          </strong>of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes (see 
          <strong>Marketing 
          </strong>in Section 5 above).
          <br>
          <br>In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Request restriction of processing 
          </strong>of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
          <ul>
            <li>if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;
            </li>
            <li>where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;
            </li>
            <li>where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
            </li>
            <li>you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Request the transfer (data portability) 
          </strong>of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Withdraw consent at any time 
          </strong>where we are relying on consent to process your personal data (which will not generally be the case). This will not however affect the lawfulness of any processing which we carried out before you withdrew your consent. Any processing activities that are not based on your consent will remain unaffected.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Kindly note that none of these data subject rights are absolute and must generally be weighed against our own legal obligations and legitimate interests. If a decision is taken to override your data subject request, you will be informed of this by our data protection team along with the reasons for our decision.

      <p>Please note that for California residents, the term personal information means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household as defined in the CCPA.&nbsp; All other capitalized terms have the same meanings as given them in the privacy policy.
      </p>
      <p>If you are a California resident who has provided personal information to Bittrex, or a California resident that reasonably believes that Bittrex collected or stores their personal information, you may exercise your rights under the CCPA and submit your requests in one of the following methods: (a) by submitting this online form; (b) by calling the following toll free number 1-833-247-1844.
        <a href="http://voice.google.com/calls?a=nc,%2B18332471844" class="gv-tel-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Call +1 833-247-1844 via Google Voice">
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>NOTE: we do not sell your personal information as that term is defined in the CCPA or under Nevada Law (Section Chapter 603A of the Nevada Revised Statutes).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>You have the right to request Bittrex to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Disclose if we have collected personal Information on you;
        </li>
        <li>Disclose the categories of personal information that we have collected on you (if any); the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom the business shares personal information;
        </li>
        <li>Disclose the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected on you (if any); and
        </li>
        <li>Delete personal information we have collected on you (if you satisfy the conditions set out in the CCPA).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In order to submit a request, we will need to verify your identity. If you have an account with us that is password-protected, we may verify your identity through our existing authentication practices for your account.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>If you do not have an account with us, and your request concerns “categories” of personal information collected, we can request from you two data points of personal information to verify your identity. If you do not have an account with us, and your request concerns specific personal information, we can request from you at least three data points of personal information as well as a signed declaration with penalty of perjury to verify your identity.
      </p>
      <p>Please note that following your verified request, we will send you your personal information from the following email address: privacy@bittrex.com (Any response to your request, including any personal information may be sent as an encrypted file).
      </p>
      <p>Please note that once you have submitted a request, we will send you a receipt, acknowledging your request, within 10 days. If, for some reason, you do not receive such a receipt within 10 days of your submitted request, please send us an email to 
        <span>privacy@bittrex.com
        </span> as an error may have occurred.
      </p>
      <p>We will process and respond to your request within 45 days after it is received (in some cases, as is allowed under the CCPA, this process may be extended by an additional 45-90 days).
      </p>
      <p>Please note, that regarding requests under subsections (a), (b), and (c) above, you may only make two requests in a 12-month period, and the information provided need only cover the 12-month period prior to your request.
      </p>
      <p>As a California resident, you also have the right to designate an agent to exercise these rights on your behalf.&nbsp; We may require proof that you have designated the authorized agent to act on your behalf and to verify your identity directly with us.&nbsp; Please contact us at 
        <a href="mailto:privacy@bittrex.com">privacy@bittrex.com
        </a> for more information if you wish to submit a request through an authorized agent.
      </p>
      <p>We hereby inform you that if you exercise any of your rights under the CCPA we may not deny you goods or services for that reason, or subject you to different prices than those paid by other consumers, unless provided otherwise under the CCPA, Federal, or State law.
      </p>

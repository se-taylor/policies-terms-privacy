There is limited or no fundamental reasoning behind the pricing of Digital Assets which may be subject to irrational and uncontrollable market forces. Whether the future price for a Digital Asset will increase or decrease is unpredictable and purely speculative. Likewise, there is a risk that a Digital Asset may not have any value whatsoever. Digital Assets are therefore traded at the User's own risk.

            <span>6.13 Digital Asset values are highly volatile and can fluctuate substantially in comparison to Fiat Currencies or traditional investment products.

Furthermore, the value of a Digital Asset may never recover if there is no interest or development in the Digital Asset. A User is therefore at risk of losing all or a substantial portion of the value of its Digital Assets. Such losses can occur in a very short period of time.

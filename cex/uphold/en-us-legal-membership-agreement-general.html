You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Login Credentials and you agree not to share your Login Credentials with any unauthorized parties.

              </p>
              <p>   3.2.1. When you first try to link your U.S. bank account with your Uphold Account, we may attempt to verify your external bank account by either an automated micro-deposit (less than $1.00) or same day micro-deposits (explained below). After your external account has been verified and set up, authorization will remain in full force and effect until you remove your bank account linked to your Uphold Account or close your Uphold Account or your bank account. We use a third-party partner, Plaid, to make these micro-deposits on our behalf.
              </p>
              <p>   3.2.2. Automated Micro-deposit. We may use an automated micro-deposit to attempt to verify your external U.S. bank account if your bank supports this method. With an automated micro-deposit, a single micro-deposit into your bank account will be made and then automatically verified within one or two business days. If the micro-deposit is verified, the micro-deposit will be reversed and we will finish setting up your external bank account. If the micro-deposit cannot be verified, we may discontinue and cancel your external bank account setup. The micro-deposit will also be reversed.
              </p>
              <p>   3.2.3. Same Day Micro-deposits. We may attempt to verify your external U.S. bank account by using same day micro-deposits. With same day micro-deposits, two separate micro-deposits will be made into your bank account in different amounts using same-day ACH. You will then be required to verify the amount of each micro-deposit within one business day. If you timely verify the amounts of both micro-deposits, the two micro-deposits will be reversed and we will finish setting up your external bank account. If you fail to timely verify the amounts of both micro-deposits, we may discontinue and cancel your external bank account setup. The micro-deposit will also be reversed.

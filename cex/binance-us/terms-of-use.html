    BAM Trading is a wholly owned subsidiary of BAM Management U.S. Holdings Inc. and is headquartered in Palo Alto,
    California. As part of an effort to offer digital asset trading technology to its customers through the
    Binance.US platform, BAM Trading entered into licensing agreements with Binance Holdings Limited ("Binance"),
    which operates the world’s largest digital asset exchange. BAM Trading and Binance share common majority
    ownership, but are not within the same corporate structure. You understand that BAM Trading and Binance are
    separate entities and that the Services are offered by BAM Trading. You agree and understand that BAM Trading
    and its Related Parties may have certain actual or potential conflicts of interest related to our decision to
    support or not support a Digital Asset or increase or decrease the scope of the services made available for such
    Digital Asset.

      </li>
      <li>
        <b>“Restricted States”
        </b> means Hawaii (HI), New York (NY), Texas (TX) and Vermont (VT).
        The list of
        Restricted States is subject to change at any time. In the event a state becomes a Restricted State, BAM
        will provide users residing in that state with notice via email, a notification on the Website, or other

      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Representations And Warranties

  <h1 class="subtitle anchor" id="useOfTheServices">Use Of The Services
  </h1>
  <div class="detail">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Digital Assets Trading Platform
        </b>. BAM operates a platform (
        <b>“Platform”
        </b>) that
        provides you with Trading Services for digital assets (also known as a ‘cryptocurrency’ or
        ‘virtual
        currency’), which is issued, stored, and/or transferred based on the protocol of a computer
        network
        known as a blockchain or a public transaction ledger (
        <b>“Digital Assets”
        </b>). You may use
        the Platform to execute the following trades: (1) sale of a Digital Asset for fiat or another Digital
        Asset; and (2) purchase of a Digital Asset with fiat or another Digital Asset.
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Staking Services
        </b>. BAM provides the option to contribute and earn rewards by participating in
        on-chain staking for certain Digital Assets eligible for staking (the “Eligible Tokens”),
        subject to the
        terms and conditions of these Terms. You may be eligible to stake Digital Assets in a third-party proof
        of stake network via the Staking Services. BAM may perform any or all of the Staking Services described
        in these Terms directly or through one or more service provider(s). If you designate Digital Assets for
        the Staking Services, BAM will stake the designated Digital Assets either (a) by delegating such Digital
        Assets to a third-party staking service provider (“Staking Services Provider”) or Related
        Party, or (b)
        by acting as a transaction validator on the applicable network for the Digital Asset being staked. If
        BAM or the Staking Services Provider successfully validates a block of transactions in a particular
        Digital Asset, you may earn a reward granted by that Digital Asset’s network. The reward will be
        determined by the protocols of the applicable network.
        <br>
        In order to use the Staking Services, you must opt-in by selecting the Eligible Tokens to stake from
        your Account. You retain ownership of the Eligible Tokens and such Eligible Tokens shall remain your
        property when staked under the terms of this Agreement. Upon opting-in a portion or your entire balance
        of Eligible Tokens, BAM shall remit to you the applicable percentage of staking rewards received from
        the Eligible Token protocol attributable to your staked Eligible Tokens (“Staking Rewards”)
        as detailed
        in your Account and the BAM 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://support.binance.us/hc/en-us/articles/360046787134-Staking-Rewards-FAQ">website
        </a>.
        The applicable percentage and timing of such remittances will: (i)
        be determined by BAM in its sole and absolute discretion; (ii) be subject to BAM’s staking fee; (iii)
        vary by the Eligible Token protocol; and (iv) be further detailed in your Account. You agree and
        understand that neither BAM or its Related Parties, nor any Staking Services Provider guarantees that
        you will receive Staking Rewards and that the applicable percentage (i) is an estimate only and not
        guaranteed, (ii) may change at any time in BAM’s sole and absolute discretion, and (iii) may be more or
        less than the actual staking rewards BAM or any Staking Services Provider receives from the Eligible
        Token protocol.
        <br>
        Eligible Assets withdrawn by you from the Staking Services may be subject to certain bonding and
        unbonding periods imposed by the protocol for which you have staked your Eligible Tokens
        (
        <b>“Unstaking
          Period”
        </b>). During the Unstaking Period, you will not continue to earn Rewards and the
        Eligible
        Tokens may
        not be available to you until the Unstaking Period has fully passed.
        <br>
        Your funds’ private keys may be held in either hot or cold storage (in a wallet), as determined solely
        by BAM in accordance with its internal security policies and procedures. You should also know that your
        funds, as well as funds belonging to other customers, may be staked to a proof-of-stake validator node
        so as to enable our Staking Services offering, as described in these Terms of Service.
        <br>
        While BAM and/or the Staking Service Provider employ measures to ensure that the Staking Services are
        accessible 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, neither BAM nor the Staking Service Provider can guarantee
        uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Staking Services or that BAM and/or the Staking Service
        Provider will correct all defects or prevent third-party disruptions or unauthorized third party access.
        In the event of such disruptions, any staked Eligible Tokens may not be generating the Staking Rewards.
        BAM will use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to provide Staking Services, directly, through
        a Related Party or via a Staking Services Provider, with respect to any Eligible Assets for which you
        are using Staking Services, but may elect to terminate Staking Services for any Eligible Asset at any
        time. You are not required to stake with BAM to maintain an Account(s) or use our Services. You may
        opt-in or opt-out of Staking Services at any time.
        <br>
        Some token protocols may subject staked assets to a “slashing” penalty and non-payment of the applicable Staking Rewards if the transaction validator incorrectly validates a transaction. BAM will use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent any staked assets from slashing; however, in the event they are, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, BAM agrees to compensate you for any slashing penalties to the extent such penalties are not a result of (i) your acts or omissions, (ii) token protocol maintenance, bugs, or errors, (iii) acts by a hacker or other malicious actor, or (iv) Force Majeure Events as defined in the General .  
        <br>
        You acknowledge and agree that (a) the continued ability to provide the Staking Services is dependent on elements beyond BAM’s, any Related Party’s or the Staking Services Provider’s control, (b) the staking of Eligible Assets or the use of the Staking Services may become subject to regulatory controls that limit, restrict, prohibit or otherwise impose conditions on such activities; and (c) the Staking Services may become subject to regulatory controls that limit, restrict, prohibit or otherwise impose conditions on such Staking Services.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Ethereum Staking
        </b>. In addition to the terms outlined above, the following terms apply when you stake ETH using BAM’s Staking Services. 
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Lockup Period
            </b>. If you decide to stake ETH, you will not be able to access or use your ETH in any way until the Ethereum blockchain’s transition to Ethereum Proof-of-Stake is complete, and a major network upgrade has taken place. BAM does not control the Ethereum blockchain and therefore has no control over the timing or completion of these upgrades, nor will BAM be able to unstake your ETH for you until after these upgrades have taken place. The Ethereum blockchain’s transition to Ethereum Proof-of-Stake may be significantly delayed or fail to occur at all. There is no guarantee that other potential setbacks will not take place which could cause your staked ETH to remain staked and therefore inaccessible by you or BAM.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>No Guarantee of Success of Upgrade
            </b>. There is a risk that the transition to Ethereum Proof-of-Stake will fail or not occur. Due to the complicated technical nature of this transition, there is no guarantee that there will ever be a successful completion date of the transition. If the network upgrade ultimately fails, you may lose all, or a portion of, your staked ETH. BAM will not be responsible for any ETH lost due to a network upgrade failure, or the value of any ETH lost while it remains staked. 
          </li>
          <li>  
            <b>ETH Staking Rewards
            </b>. Any rewards you accrue from staking ETH will remain locked on the Ethereum blockchain, and cannot be accessed by BAM or by you, until the network upgrade is complete. Any ETH Rewards reflected in your account during the lockup period are an estimate only and not guaranteed. You agree and understand that neither BAM nor its Related Parties, nor any Staking Services Provider guarantees that you will receive ETH Staking Rewards and that the applicable rewards rate (i) is an estimate only, (ii) may change at any time in BAM’s sole and absolute discretion, and (iii) may be more or less than the actual staking rewards BAM or any Staking Services Provider receives from the Eligible Token protocol. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Peer-to-Peer (Digital-Asset Only) Transfers
        </b>. BAM provides you the option to send, request, and receive certain Digital Assets to or from other users on our Platform for personal purposes (“
        <b>P2P Service
        </b>”).  After you have funded your Account with Digital Assets eligible for sending to other users, and while such Digital Assets remain in your Account, you will be able to use the P2P Service.  As a party initiating a transfer (“
        <b>Sender
        </b>”), you will send a certain type and amount of eligible Digital Assets by designating a recipient (“
        <b>Recipient
        </b>”) by providing such instructions to BAM through the use of the P2P Service. You may also request eligible Digital Assets be transferred to you through the P2P Service, as described below.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Eligibility
            </b>. Only BAM Trading users who are eligible to use the Services and who have passed Identity Verification and/or Enhanced Due Diligence (as set forth in the terms above) can use the P2P Service as a Sender or as a Recipient. Senders and Recipients may not use the P2P Service if they are residents of a Restricted State. Senders may only initiate P2P transfers to a Recipient who is a BAM Trading user who is eligible to use the Services and who has passed Identity Verification and/or Enhanced Due Diligence (as set forth in the terms above). Recipients may only receive P2P transfers from a Sender who is a BAM Trading user.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Additional Terms for Senders
            </b>. In addition to the terms outlined above, the following terms apply to Senders who use the P2P Service.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Process and Identification of a Recipient
                </b>. As a Sender, you will be able to send eligible Digital Assets to a single, individual Recipient by searching for a user’s name in your contact list (if you have provided us with access to it) or by entering their email or phone number if they are not in your contact list.  In order to send the Digital Assets, you must provide the (i) 
                <b>amount
                </b>; and (ii) 
                <b>type
                </b> of eligible Digital Asset that you wish to transfer (the “
                <b>P2P Instructions
                </b>”). By submitting P2P Instructions to us, you authorize us to transfer the designated Digital Assets to the Recipient.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Transaction Timing
                </b>. You understand and agree that when you initiate a transaction by entering P2P Instructions and confirming the transaction, BAM will begin processing the transfer instruction immediately and the designated Digital Assets may leave your Account as soon as the moment you confirm the transaction. Any Digital Assets you send through the P2P Service will be reflected in the Recipient’s Account, and will be available for use by the Recipient immediately following a successful and authorized transfer confirmed by you.
              </li>
              <li>  
                <b>Failed Transfers
                </b>. A transfer initiated by a Sender may fail for various reasons (“
                <b>Failed Transfer
                </b>”). As a Sender, you may be able to re-initiate a failed transfer by following the same steps as identified in the Transfer Process above for a new P2P transfer. For instances of a failed transfer, you will be notified and receive a failed message with notice of the failed transfer. In the instances of a failed transfer, the attempted transfer of Digital Assets will remain in your Account, and the Digital Assets will not be transferred to the Recipient’s Account.
              </li>
              <li>  
                <b>Pending Transfers
                </b>. Certain transactions initiated by you, as a Sender, may have a “Pending” status as displayed in your Account (“
                <b>Pending Transfers
                </b>”). These transfers will remain in pending status for a certain period of time depending on various factors and as soon as our system limitations allow. Pending Transfers will either fail due to various reasons or will eventually become a successful transfer.
              </li>
              <li>  
                <b>Liability for Transactions
                </b>. With the exception of Pending Transfers or Failed Transfers, transfers of Digital Assets initiated through the P2P Service will be transferred immediately from the Sender to the Recipient upon the Sender’s confirmation and authorization of the transfer.  Please ensure you are sending the correct 
                <b>amount
                </b> and 
                <b>type
                </b> of Digital Asset to the correct recipient, as completed transfers cannot be canceled or reversed.  You agree that we shall not incur any liability if we are unable to complete any transaction because of: (i) insufficient Digital Assets in your Account to complete the transfer according to your P2P Instructions; (ii) any malfunction of the P2P Service due to circumstances beyond our control; (iii) circumstances that you were already aware of or reasonably should have been aware of at the time you initiated your transfer instruction; (iv) inaccurate or insufficient P2P Instructions; (v) any delays or other circumstances caused by any pending or failed transfers; (vi) any errors or any indirect or direct actions taken by you, that result in a mistaken or accidental transfer; or (vii) fluctuations in the market value of the Digital Asset.
              </li>
              <li>  
                <b>Fees
                </b>. While we do not charge fees in order for you to use the P2P Service, if you choose to initiate the Digital Asset transfer based on its equivalent U.S. dollar amount, we will, in our sole discretion, calculate the amount of Digital Asset to transfer to the Recipient based on the price of the Digital Asset and market conditions at or around the time of the transfer.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>  
            <b>Additional Terms for Recipients
            </b>. In addition to the terms outlined above, the following terms apply to Recipients who receive Digital Assets via the P2P Service.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Receipt of Digital Assets
                </b>. Any Digital Assets you receive through the P2P Service will be reflected in your Account, and available for use by you immediately, so long as a successful transfer is authorized and confirmed by the Sender.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Failed Transfers
                </b>. A transfer initiated by a Sender may fail for various reasons. A Sender may be able to re-initiate a failed transfer by following the same steps as identified in the Transfer Process above for a new P2P transfer. For instances of a failed transfer, a Sender will be notified and receive a failed message with notice of the failed transfer. In the instances of a failed transfer, the attempted transfer of Digital Assets will remain in the Sender’s Account, and the Digital Assets will not be transferred to your Account. Each Recipient agrees that we shall not incur any liability if we are unable to complete any transfer initiated by a Sender for any reason.
              </li>
              <li>  
                <b>Invalid Transfers
                </b>. If you receive a transfer of Digital Assets through the P2P Service, and we later determine, in our sole discretion, that the transfer was invalid for any reason, such transfer will be treated as an Erroneous Deposit and subject to the terms for Erroneous Deposits set forth below.
              </li>
              <li>  
                <b>Fees
                </b>. While we do not charge fees in order for you to use the P2P Service, if the Sender chooses to initiate the Digital Asset transfer based on its equivalent U.S. dollar amount, we will, in our sole discretion, calculate the amount of Digital Asset to transfer to you based on the market value of the Digital Asset and market conditions at or around the time of the transfer.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Requesting Digital Assets
            </b>. You may also request eligible Digital Assets be transferred to you through the P2P Service by designating the 
            <b>amount
            </b> and 
            <b>type
            </b> of eligible Digital Assets and your selected Sender (a “
            <b>P2P Request
            </b>”). You will be able to initiate a P2P Request to a Sender by searching for a user’s name in your contact list (if you have provided us with access to it) or by entering their email or phone number if they are not in your contact list. A Sender may approve or deny a P2P Request within his or her sole discretion. If the Sender authorizes your P2P Request, your P2P Request will become the Sender’s P2P Instructions and will be processed as described above. If the Sender fails to approve the P2P Request, then you will be notified.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Gifting Digital Assets
            </b>. Senders may choose to transfer Digital Assets to single or multiple Recipient(s) through the “
            <b>Crypto Box
            </b>” feature on our mobile application. To use the Crypto Box, a Sender must provide Instructions through the Crypto Box feature on the Binance.US mobile application.  Where the P2P Services can only be used to send Digital Assets to one Recipient per transaction, Crypto Box allows Senders to transfer either an (i) identical; or (ii) randomized amount of Digital Assets to one or more Recipient(s) through the generation of a single redemption code (“
            <b>Redemption Code
            </b>”). Senders may share the Redemption Code through their own, chosen communication channels to selected Recipient(s) in their network. The Redemption Code may only be redeemed by the set number of Recipient(s), and will be redeemed on a first-come, first-served basis. Although Recipients do not need to have an Account in order to receive a Redemption Code, Recipients must create an Account, and therefore (i) be Eligible to use the Services, and (ii) pass Identity Verification and/or Enhanced Due Diligence, in order to redeem the gifted Digital Assets through the Redemption Code. The Sender must choose the 
            <b>total
            </b> amount of Digital Assets to be transferred and the 
            <b>type
            </b> of Digital Assets to be transferred before the Redemption Code is generated. Once the Recipient(s) receive(s) the Redemption Code, he or she can enter the Redemption Code to redeem the Digital Assets only on the BAM Trading Platform.  If the Sender elects to send a randomized amount of Digital Assets to the Recipient(s), the amount each Recipient receives will be determined by an algorithm that simulates a random split between the Recipient(s). Once the Sender chooses to create a Crypto Box and a Redemption Code is generated, it cannot be canceled, and the Digital Asset will no longer be available in the Sender’s Account. Redemption Codes will expire after 48 hours.  If a Redemption Code expires prior to being redeemed by a Recipient(s), the Digital Asset(s) associated with such Redemption Code will transfer back to the Sender's Account. Any unclaimed amounts of the Digital Asset(s) by the Recipients(s) of a Crypto Box will be returned to the Sender’s Account. Except for as described immediately above, each Crypto Box transaction is subject to the same terms and conditions as any other P2P Service transaction, including the terms regarding Liability for Transactions set forth above.

        <b>Product Offerings

        <b>Third-Party Payment Partners

        dollar payment between you and BAM, including but not limited to withdrawals or deposits to your BAM
        Fiat Wallet or Linked Wallet, as applicable. The name on your linked bank account must match the name

      <li>
        <b>Fiat Currency
        </b>. U.S. dollar deposits associated with your Account(s), and available for use in executing trades, are accessible via either (i) a third-party Linked Wallet operated by Prime Trust, LLC, which balances are subject to the additional terms set forth in the 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.binance.us/prime-trust-linked-wallet-addendum">Linked Wallet Addendum

        well as
        the terms of service between you and Prime Trust, LLC; or (ii) a stored value wallet issued by BAM
        denominated in U.S. dollars (
        <b>“BAM Fiat Wallet”
        </b>). The fiat currency (the U.S. dollar deposits) associated with your Account(s) is owned and controlled by you and title to the fiat currency (the U.S. dollar deposits) in your Account(s), shall at all times remain with you, subject to applicable “pass-through” deposit insurance conditions described immediately below.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>BAM Fiat Wallet
            </b>. All U.S. dollar deposits associated with your BAM Fiat Wallet are owned by you and held in an omnibus account for the sole benefit of customers at either (i) Silvergate Bank, a California state-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) or (ii) Signature Bank, a New York state-chartered bank that is a member of the FDIC (collectively, the “Sponsor Banks”). Title to your BAM Fiat Wallet, in addition to the U.S. dollar deposits associated with your BAM Fiat Wallet, shall at all times remain with you. BAM Fiat Wallets have been established with the intention that U.S. dollars deposited in such BAM Fiat Wallets be eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance, up to the per-depositor coverage limit then in place (currently $250,000 per eligible individual), assuming regulatory requirements are met. FDIC insurance does not protect against the failure of BAM or malfeasance by any BAM employee. Digital assets are not eligible for FDIC insurance protections. FDIC pass-through insurance protects your U.S. dollars deposited in your BAM Fiat Wallet against the risk of loss in the event a Sponsor Bank fails, subject to applicable limitations and assuming specific deposit insurance requirements are met. It is our policy to comply with the regulations and other requirements of the FDIC for pass-through deposit insurance. BAM will maintain records of your ownership of U.S. dollar deposits associated with your BAM Fiat Wallet, in a manner reasonably understood to satisfy the FDIC’s requirements for obtaining “pass-through” deposit insurance. All U.S. dollar deposits associated with a BAM Fiat Wallet and held in an omnibus account at a Sponsor Bank are held apart from BAM’s corporate funds and BAM will never use funds held in an omnibus account at a Sponsor Bank for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes. In the event we terminate our relationship with a Sponsor Bank, the balance associated with your BAM Fiat Wallet will neither be affected nor will the transfer of such funds from such Sponsor Bank to another U.S. bank jeopardize the availability of FDIC insurance, subject to applicable limitations and assuming regulatory requirements are met.

        </b>. As a money services business
        registered with the
        U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, BAM is required to, among other
        things, identify users on our Platform. You agree to provide us with the information we request for the
        purposes of identity verification and the detection of money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or
        any other financial crime and permit us to keep a record of such information for at least six years (see
        below for details). You will need to complete certain verification procedures before you are permitted
        to use the Services and your access to one or more Account(s) or the Services, and the Limits (defined
        below) that apply to your use of the Account(s) or the Services may be altered as a result of
        information collected on an ongoing basis. In addition, as part of our risk management and fraud
        prevention processes we may from time-to-time require you to reconfirm or update some of the information
        you entered when you took part in our identity verification procedure. The information we request may
        include certain personal information, including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone
        number, email address, date of birth, taxpayer identification number, social security number or
        government identification number, scans of government-issued identity documents and when applicable bank

        and in some cases (where permitted by law), special categories of personal data, such as your biometric
        information. BAM will request your consent before collecting any biometric information from you. In
        addition to providing this information, to facilitate compliance with global industry standards for data
        retention, you agree to permit us to keep a record of such information for the lifetime of your
        Account(s) plus six years beyond the termination of your Account(s). You agree to keep us updated if any

        necessary based on the results of such inquiries. When we carry out these inquiries, you acknowledge and
        agree that your personal information may be disclosed to identity verification, compliance data
        recordation, credit reference, fraud prevention, or financial crime agencies and that these agencies may
        respond to our inquiries in full. If there is reasonable doubt that any information provided by you is

        corrections, remove relevant information directly and, as the case may be, terminate all or part of the

        be accessed directly using the Website or by such other mode of access (including but not limited to
        through the BAM APIs) as BAM may prescribe from time to time. The use of the Website and other methods
        may be subject to such additional terms as may be prescribed by BAM. You are only permitted to access
        your Account(s) using your Account(s) login credentials and other required forms of authentication. We
        require multi-factor authentication to keep your Account(s) safe and secure. As a result, you may be
        required to use at least two forms of authentication when accessing your Account(s) and performing
        certain operations in your Account(s). Forms of multi-factor authentication in addition to your login
        credentials may include verification tokens delivered through SMS or a specified and supported 2FA

        device (e.g., phone
        or tablet) on which the operating system has been tampered with in any way, you do so at your own risk.
        This includes, but is not limited to, a “rooted” (Android) or “jailbroken” (iOS)
        device. We reserve the
        right in our sole discretion to prohibit access from or by any device on which the operating system has
        been or is suspected of having been modified or tampered with. You agree that we may provide your 2FA
        data to a third-party service provider in order to help us authenticate you. You must update to the most
        recent operating system(s) supported by BAM or Related Parties on your necessary equipment (such as a
        computer or smartphone) as soon as such operating system(s) update becomes available. We reserve the
        right in our sole discretion to limit or suspend the Services offered to you if you attempt to access
        your Account(s)or the Services on an outdated or unsupported operating system(s). As further described

        </a>, BAM does not represent or warrant that your Account(s) or
        any Services will be

        purposes. Under no circumstances shall any of the Indemnified Persons be responsible or liable for any
        direct or indirect losses (including loss of profits, business, or opportunities), damages, or costs
        suffered by you or any other person or entity due to any such termination, suspension, or restriction of
        access to any Account(s) or Services.

      <li>
        <b>Corporate Account Usage
        </b>. If you are a corporation, legal person, entity, or other organization
        for whom BAM maintains a corporate account for the provision of services (
        <b>“Corporate
          Account”
        </b>), you must
        ensure that your Corporate Account(s) will not be used by persons that have not completed identity
        verification (See 
        <a href="#identityVerification">Identity Verification
        </a>). You must notify us
        immediately of any breach of security,
        loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your username, password, or security information. BAM reserves the
        right to terminate, suspend, or restrict your access to any Corporate Account(s) or Services if there is
        reasonable suspicion, as determined in BAM’s sole and absolute discretion, that the person logged into
        your Corporate Account(s) is not the natural person authorized to use the Corporate Account or if we
        suspect that the Corporate Account(s) have been or will be used for any illegal, fraudulent, or
        unauthorized purposes. Under no circumstances shall any of the Indemnified Persons be responsible or
        liable for any direct or indirect losses (including loss of profits, business or opportunities),
        damages, or costs suffered by you or any other person or entity due to any such termination, suspension,
        or restriction of access to any Corporate Account(s). At BAM’s discretion, you may access the segregated
        account nested under the primary Corporate Account (
        <b>“Sub-Account”
        </b>) feature on the
        Platform. Each natural
        person associated with a Sub-Account must undergo identity verification (See 
        <a href="#identityVerification">Identity Verification
        </a>).
        Only one natural person may be associated with a particular Sub-Account. You must notify us immediately
        of any breach of security, loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your username, password, or security
        information. BAM reserves the right to terminate, suspend, or restrict your access to any or all of the
        Services, if there is reasonable suspicion, as determined in BAM’s sole and absolute discretion, that
        more than one natural person has access to and/or transacts using the same Sub-Account, or if we suspect
        that Sub-Account(s) have been or will be used for any illegal, fraudulent, or unauthorized purposes.
        Under no circumstances shall any of the Indemnified Persons be responsible or liable for any direct or
        indirect losses (including loss of profits, business or opportunities), damages, or costs suffered by
        you or any other person or entity due to any such termination, suspension, or restriction of access to
        any Corporate Account(s).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Safeguarding Your Account
        </b>. At all times, you shall maintain adequate security and control of all
        of your Account(s) details, passwords, personal identification numbers, API keys, API secret keys, or
        any other codes that you use to access your Account(s) or the Services or to send any instruction,
        request, or order given to BAM in relation to the operation of your Account(s)or to execute any
        Transaction (defined below), through such medium and in such form and manner as BAM may require
        (
        <b>“Instruction”
        </b>) to us.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Information
        </b>. BAM reserves the right to request, and you agree to provide, any and all information
        and documents BAM deems relevant or necessary in connection with the use of the Platform and/or the
        Services. BAM shall have the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to suspend or restrict your
        access to any Account(s) or Services pending submission of such information and documents. All
        information processed by BAM, its Related Parties, or other parties from which BAM receives data
        management services may be transferred, processed, and stored anywhere in the world, including, but not
        limited to, the United States. Other countries’ data protection laws may differ from the laws where you
        live. BAM endeavors to protect your information consistent with applicable law. Under no circumstances
        shall any of the Indemnified Persons be responsible or liable for any direct or indirect losses
        (including loss of profits, business, or opportunities), damages, or costs suffered by you or any other
        person or entity due to any such termination, suspension, or restriction of access to any Account(s) or
        Services.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Account Closure
        </b>. You may terminate your Account(s) at any time by following the account
        termination procedures as prescribed by BAM from time to time. You will not be charged for terminating
        your Account(s), although you will be required to pay any outstanding amounts owed to us. You authorize
        us to cancel or suspend any pending transactions at the time of cancellation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Account Termination, Suspension, or Restriction
        </b>. As detailed below, BAM has the right to
        terminate, suspend, or restrict your access to your Account(s) or Services, as well as take any other
        action as we deem necessary, for the reasons detailed below.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Death of Account Holder
        </b>. You agree that in the event of your death, the representative(s) of your
        estate or the survivor or survivors shall give BAM written notice thereof as soon as practicable. If BAM
        receives legal documentation or has reason to believe you have died, BAM will freeze your account. Your
        account will be frozen until: (1) a representative of your estate or authorized beneficiary, if located
        in a non-Restricted State and not otherwise prohibited from doing so, opens a BAM Account or, if located
        in a Restricted State, provides wire transfer or ACH transfer instructions and provides sufficient legal
        documentation that they are entitled to receive the assets in your Account; or (2) you provide
        satisfactory notification to BAM that you are not deceased. Beneficiaries receiving a wire transfer or
        ACH transfer will receive the liquidated value of the assets in the Account less any fees and costs
        associated with transfer. BAM’s ability to provide your representative(s) with the assets in your
        Account is subject to the restrictions imposed by law, regulation, court orders, technical capabilities,
        best practices, and these Terms. BAM’s ability to provide your representative(s) with the assets in your
        Account may also be impacted by the location of residence of the representative(s) and the ability of
        the representative to open a BAM account to receive your Account assets. BAM does not commit to any
        particular timeline for the transfer of your Account assets.

        <b>Transactions
        </b>. Except to the extent described elsewhere in these Terms of Use, when you sell,
        purchase, send, or carry out other transactions in Digital Asset(s), other asset(s), or product(s) as BAM may
        from time-to-time permit to be carried out on the Platform (
        <b>“Transactions”
        </b>), you are
        not Transacting
        with BAM. Rather, BAM acts as the agent, transacting on your behalf, to facilitate such Transaction
        between you and other users. You can purchase Digital Asset(s) using: (1) Digital Asset(s) or fiat
        currency in your BAM Account(s) (through the use of the BAM Fiat Wallet or third-party Linked Wallet, as
        applicable to your BAM Account); (2) a valid bank account in the name that matches your Account(s); or
        (3) a credit or debit card in the name that matches your Account(s) (
        <b>“Payment
          Methods”
        </b>). Using a Payment
        Method to purchase Digital Asset(s) generally will initiate on the Business Day (defined below) that we
        receive your Instructions. Digital Asset(s) that you purchase will be deposited into your Account(s) as
        soon as the funds have settled to BAM, which may take up to ten Business Days if the purchase was made
        via a bank account, credit, or debit card. As further described under 
        <a href="#noWarranty">No
          Warranty

        represent or warrant that any Transaction will be completed successfully or within a specific time

        direct or indirect losses (including loss of profits, business, or opportunities), damages, or costs

        promote liquidity and facilitate trading on the Platform and with respect to certain of BAM’s other
        trading products and services. BAM’s determinations concerning whether and how to onboard such market
        makers are made entirely at its sole and absolute discretion. You acknowledge and agree that certain

        (“OTC”) trading, are
        executed against or facilitated by BAM, Related Parties, and/or other entities, and that it is
        anticipated that there are circumstances under which BAM will transact on the platform for its own
        account. You further acknowledge, agree, and accept that (1) such market makers may enter into any
        Transaction with you as your counterparty; (2) such market makers may also maintain positions in various
        Digital Assets as part of their market making activities, including positions in Digital Assets that are
        contrary to your positions; and (3) under no circumstances shall any of the Indemnified Persons be

        necessary.

        <b>Third Party Applications
        </b>. You may decide to grant access to your Account or Account credentials
        to a third party (including, without limitation, third party applications, bots, or browser extensions)
        (each, a 
        <b>“Third-Party Application”
        </b>). By doing so, you are granting permission to a
        Third-Party
        Application to access or connect to your Account, and you expressly authorize BAM to provide information
        to, or accept information, including Instructions, from, such Third-Party Application. You should
        carefully consider both the functionality purportedly offered by the Third-Party Application and the
        developer offering the functionality before authorizing the application to access your Account. Unless
        otherwise stated, we have no control over Third-Party Applications and assume no responsibility for
        developers’ actions. If you authorize a Third-Party Application to connect to your Account and take
        actions on your behalf, you assume all risks associated with the use of that Third Party Application. If
        you have disputes with any Third-Party Application, you will need to address them directly with such
        Third-Party Application, or its developer. You acknowledge that we do not endorse or recommend any
        Third-Party Application for your use or that of any other user. Under no circumstances shall any of the

      <li>
        <b>Reversals &amp; Cancellations
        </b>. You cannot cancel, reverse, or change any transaction marked as
        complete or pending. If your payment is not successful, if your payment method has insufficient funds,
        or if you reverse a payment made from funds in your bank account, you authorize BAM, in its sole
        discretion, either to cancel the transaction or to debit your other payment methods in any amount
        necessary to complete the transaction. You are responsible for maintaining an adequate balance in order
        to avoid overdraft, non-sufficient funds (“NSF”), or similar fees charged by your payment
        provider. We
        reserve the right to refuse to process, or to cancel or reverse, any Transaction or Transfers in our
        sole discretion, even after funds have been debited from your account(s), if we suspect the transaction
        involves (or has a high risk of involvement in) money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any
        other type of financial crime; in response to a subpoena, court order, or other government order; if we
        reasonably suspect that the transaction is erroneous; or if BAM suspects the transaction relates to a
        Prohibited Use or a Prohibited Business as set forth below. In such instances, BAM will reverse the
        transaction and we are under no obligation to allow you to reinstate a purchase or sale order at the
        same price or on the same terms as the canceled transaction.

        by BAM or any third party (including but not limited to another customer of BAM), you hereby authorize
        BAM, in its sole discretion, to withdraw these assets from your Account(s). If you receive erroneous
        deposits into your Account(s) and withdraw those assets before BAM does so, BAM reserves the right to
        demand the return of these assets, and should you refuse to do so, to liquidate assets in your
        Account(s) without notice. Under no circumstances shall any of the Indemnified Persons be responsible or
        liable for any direct or indirect losses (including loss of profits, business or opportunities),

        SERVICES:
        <ul>
          <li>
            the risk of loss in trading Digital Assets may be substantial and losses may occur over a short
            period of time;
          </li>
          <li>
            the price and liquidity of Digital Assets has been subject to large fluctuations in the past and
            may be subject to large fluctuations in the future;
          </li>
          <li>Digital Assets are not legal tender, are not backed by any government, and accounts and value

            in your jurisdiction, BAM may not be regulated as a financial institution;

            executive orders, judicial interpretations of statutes and regulations, legislative and
            regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, territorial, or international level may
            adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, taxing, and value of Digital Assets;

          <li>
            Digital Asset blockchains may Fork, and we may not support the Forked Digital Asset promptly or

          <li>
            some transactions in Digital Assets shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger,

            Transactions on the Platform;
          </li>
          <li>
            the value of Digital Assets may be derived from or influenced by the continued willingness of
            market participants to exchange fiat currencies for Digital Assets, which may result in the
            potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular Digital Asset should the market
            for that Digital Asset disappear;
          </li>

          </li>

            the nature of Digital Assets means that technological difficulties experienced by BAM may
            prevent access to, or use of, your Digital Assets;
          </li>
          <li>
            the volatility and unpredictability of the price of Digital Assets relative to fiat currency may
            result in significant loss over a short period of time;
          </li>
          <li>there is no assurance that a person who accepts a Digital Asset as payment today will continue
            to do so in the future; 
          </li>
          <li>any bond or trust account maintained by BAM for the benefit of its customers may not be
            sufficient to cover all losses incurred by customers;

          <li>BAM may experience sophisticated cyberattacks, unexpected surges in activity, or other
            operational or technical difficulties that may cause interruptions in the Services;
          </li>
          <li>BAM having Digital Assets on deposit or with any third-party, including Related Parties, in a
            custodial relationship has attendant risks, which include security breaches, risk of contractual
            breach, and risk of loss; and 
          </li>
          <li>Digital Assets blockchains may become congested or become nonoperational because of attacks,
            bugs, hard forks, or other unforeseeable reasons.

        BAM does not provide any financial, investment, business, accounting, tax, legal, or other advice to
        you. BAM is not holding any fiat monies and/or Digital Assets as your trustee, and is not acting as your
        broker, futures commission merchant, intermediary, agent, trustee, advisor or in any fiduciary capacity.
        All Transactions are executed automatically, based on your Instructions (defined below), and you are
        solely responsible for determining whether any investment, investment strategy, or Transaction is
        appropriate for you based on your personal investment objectives, financial circumstances, and risk
        tolerance. 
        <br>
        While BAM has implemented policies and procedures designed to effect compliance with relevant laws and
        regulations, there can be no assurance that BAM and its employees will not fail to comply with new laws
        and regulations or with interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or that its policies and
        procedures for listing digital assets on its platform will always be in line with such laws and
        regulations.

    <b>Notice to All Customers Regarding the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (Regulation GG)
    </b>
    <br> 
    <br>
    The Unlawful Internet Gambling Act (
    <b>“UIGEA”
    </b>) of 2006 prohibits Binance.US from processing
    restricted transactions. Restricted transactions are transactions in which a person accepts credit, funds,
    instruments or other proceeds from another person in connection with unlawful internet gambling. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The UIGEA, signed into law in 2006, prohibits any person engaged in the business of betting or wagering (as
    defined in the Act) from knowingly accepting payments in connection with the participation of another person in
    unlawful internet gambling. The United States Department of Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board have issued a
    joint final rule, Regulation GG, to implement this Act. 
    <br>
    <br>
    As defined in Regulation GG, unlawful internet gambling means to “place, receive or otherwise knowingly
    transmit a bet or wager is unlawful under any applicable Federal or State law in the State or Tribal
    lands in which the bet or wager is initiated, received or otherwise made.” 
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>ACH Returns and Chargebacks
    </b>. In using your Account(s), should you initiate an ACH transaction using fiat
    currency from a personal bank account, whether to acquire digital assets or for any other reason, you are
    responsible for ensuring that BAM is reimbursed for any amounts credited to your Account(s). Incurring a
    returned ACH transaction or chargeback is a violation of these Terms, and upon such occurrence you are solely
    responsible for reimbursing BAM for the full amount of the ACH return or chargeback. Any ACH return or
    chargeback resulting from the use of your Account(s) or Services may result in an immediate suspension and/or
    restriction of your Accounts(s) and Services. To reactivate suspended and/or restricted Account(s) and Services,
    you must reimburse BAM for the full value of the ACH or chargeback. You are liable for any credited amounts in
    such event, and you authorize and grant BAM the right to deduct all such amounts, as well as any costs and fees
    incurred as a result of the ACH return or chargeback, directly from any assets in your Account(s) without
    notice. Should the assets in your Account(s) be insufficient to reimburse BAM for the full amount of the ACH
    return or chargeback, you are responsible for reimbursing BAM any balance. Should you refuse to do so, your
    Account(s) will be terminated and BAM can and will pursue recovery of the balance through legal means and
    consistent with these Terms. Under no circumstances shall any of the Indemnified Persons be responsible or
    liable for any direct or indirect losses (including loss of profits, business or opportunities), damages, or
    costs suffered by you or any other person or entity, due to any of the Indemnified Persons’ action or inaction
    taken as a result of an ACH return or chargeback.

        To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law
        requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identified each
        person who opens an account. 
        <br>
        What this means to you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth for
        individuals, and any other information that will allow us to identify you. In certain situations, we may
        also ask to see a form of identification with your photograph. For entities we may ask to see formative
        documents, and for private investment vehicles and trusts we may ask to see evidence of source of funds
        and beneficial ownership or other identifying documents.

    common law claims, and those based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, shall

    to the arbitration, except by mutual agreement of all parties; and (3) be limited to one deposition per party,

        <strong>Privacy Rights. 
        </strong>The CCPA grants individuals the following rights:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Information. 
            </strong>You can request information about how we have collected, used and shared your personal information during the past 12 months. For details about the personal information we have collected over the last 12 months, including the categories of sources, please see the
            <!-- --> 
            <a href="#collect">What We Collect
            </a> section above. We collect this information for the business and commercial purposes described in the
            <!-- --> 
            <a href="#info">How We Use Information
            </a>section above. We share this information with the categories of third parties described in the

            <!-- -->section above.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Access. 
            </strong>You can request a copy of the personal information that we maintain about you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Deletion. 
            </strong>You can ask us to delete the personal information that we collected or maintain about you.
          </li>
        </ol>Please note that the CCPA limits these rights by, for example, prohibiting us from providing certain sensitive information in response to an access request and limiting the circumstances in which we must comply with a deletion request.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How To Submit A Request. 
        </strong>If you would like to submit a request for information, access, or deletion, please contact
        <!-- --> 
        <a href="mailto:privacy@binance.us">privacy@binance.us
        </a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Identity Verification. 
        </strong>The CCPA requires us to verify the identity of the individual submitting a request to access or delete personal information before providing a substantive response to the request. You may only make a verifiable request for access twice within a 12-month period. We will ask you to verify your identity when you submit a request. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable request does not require you to create an account with us.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Authorized Agents. 
        </strong>California residents can empower an “authorized agent” to submit requests on their behalf. We will require the authorized agent to have a written authorization confirming that authority.
